          <h1>Day two: Four-way action</h1>
        
        <p>I raise to $6 from middle with AKo. The table captain calls. A moderately
clueful player on the button raises to $22. Then the loose-passive calling
station in the small blind calls. You don’t see that very often.</p>

<p>I’m in something of a pickle. If I call to try to hit top pair the clueful
player and the journalist will likely overcall and I will find myself in a
difficult position if I don’t hit top pair. If I do hit, it may be hard to get
paid off by the cluefull player, or maybe even the calling station.</p>

<p>If I raise I will be showing a lot of strength to the players behind me. The
captain was probably playing implied odds, with suited connectors or small pair,
and will fold.</p>

<p>If the cluefull player has AA or KK or maybe QQ he’ll probably push in. If not,
he’ll probably fold a lot of hands that beat me TT, JJ, QQ or AK as well as
hands that I can lose a lot too but am less likely to win a lot from; AQ, AJ.</p>

<p>However a three bet will likely not scare off the calling station. That’ll leave
me in position, in a big pot, with probably a much better hand, against a guy
who will pay me off almost every time.</p>

<p>I raised another $58 into the $56 pot.</p>

<p>If the cluefull player had pushed at this point and the calling station had
folded, it would have been another $80 for me to call for a $172 pot. He cannot
reasonably think the calling station would fold. On top of that, I’ve shown
extreme strength here.</p>

<p>I’d need 31% equity to call $80 into a $172 pot. If he’s as clueful as I think
he is we can reasonably conclude his range is KK+ and my equity is 20%. A clear
fold.</p>

<p>If he’s the type to marry QQ, then my equity goes up to 30% and it’s still a
fold. Especially since I don’t know if he’d really do that with QQ.</p>

<p>If he’s a lot looser than I thought and would wildly overplay JJ in this
situation, my equity is 34% and I’m not losing much by folding.</p>

<p>However, there is still a calling station behind him. If he calls the all-in,
that bloats the pot to $252. I am only left with $120 behind, and the calling
station has me covered. There is no way I’m folding at that point, so the
situation is the same if the calling station goes all-in and I call all in.</p>

<p>I’m now putting in $120 more. The main pot will be $330. The side pot will be
$80. We’ll ignore the side pot since it makes up so little of the money in the
middle.</p>

<p>I put $80 more in the main pot to make it’s total $330, so I need 24% equity for
that to be a breakeven call. Even with a wide range like QQ+ for the clueful
player and AJ+ and TT+ for the loose-passive player my equity is only 20%.</p>

<p>That’s a very extensive digression. And all very moot because the clueful player
folded.</p>

<p>The loose-passive small blind called and I had exactly the situation I wanted.
The pot was $190, effective stacks were $120 and I was in position against a
very loose-passive player.</p>

<p>The flop was J82 rainbow. He checked. I decided I was likely ahead and bet $40.
He called. Loose as he was, I don’t think he would have made that call without a
pair. I put him on 99, TT, QQ, or 77.</p>

<p>So now I was in another bind and I had to get lucky.</p>

<p>The turn was Q. Check, check.</p>

<p>The river was 5. Check, check.</p>

<p>Maybe I should have used the Q as a chance to bluff. But my last $80 in a $270
pot doesn’t seem like enough to scare such an extremely loose player. I may have
gotten 77 to fold, but not much else and even that is not very likely.</p>

<p>He turned over AJ.</p>

<p>It wasn’t much of a consolation at the time, but in hindsight I think I played
very well and saved $80.</p>

<p>Bad beat: -$120.</p>
