<p>I played Brackenbury along with a few other characters in Shakespeare at Play’s
Richard III August 15 and 16, 2009 in the park at the Buena Vista library in
Burbank.</p>

<p>If you were there you were part of a very special outdoor theater experience and
I thank you.</p>

<p>If you weren’t there you can live vicariously through Brian McGackin’s <a href="http://www.burbankleader.com/articles/2009/08/19/entertainment/gnp-shakespeare081909.1.txt">account
in the Burbank
Leader</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully some pictures will be forthcoming.</p>
