<p>I am back in the booth today recording one last line of narration for “Project:
Life.”</p>

<p>I had the feeling when I first saw this script that this was going to be a
really awesome movie. After all this time I am even more certain about it and I
can’t wait to see (and especially hear) the final cut.</p>
