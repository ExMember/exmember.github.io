<p>A very kind review from RS Bailey on Curve Wire.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Tiger Tiger Burning Bright” is well-written and intelligent play with a
genuine feel for the underside of life and the everyday people it affects. Sam
Nickens has directed it with a natural fluidity and brought forth some
monumental performances from his cast.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Damien Burke brings a dark internal lure to Clarence.</p>
</blockquote>
