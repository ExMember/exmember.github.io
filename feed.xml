        <title>Allow the Caste System</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In January, I saw this announcement from Nikki Frey. Nikki is the editor of L.A.
Mentary, the local Mensa newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I’d like to get a paragraph or 2 (or more) from lots of you about your
experience &amp;amp; ideas to improve education.  I figure a taste of opinions from
various people will be interesting to the readers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must have been in a mood that day, because I darted off a response that
was brash and unambivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I unthinkingly assumed that Nikki would use it for background or select quotes
for an article surveying attitudes on education. I was shocked when I found out
they were printing it, in its entirety, in the April 2022 edition of L.A.
Mentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I disapprove of the headline Nikki added: “Allow the Caste System.” I do not
know what that is suppose to mean. I do not think the caste system is something we
should continue to allow. It upsets me that Nikki or others might read that into
what I wrote, or that anyone would think that is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I stand by the content of my writing, had I realized it was going to a
larger audience I would have been much more cautious. But as it is public now, I
will include it here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Schooling as we know it was designed to teach compliance. The primary outcomes
are acculturation and compliance which is vitally important for people who
need to purchase labor and exploit laborers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The secondary outcome is to separate adults from children in order to make
those adults available to those who need to purchase labor and exploit
laborers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Colleges and universities function primarily as filters and indicators of
class and caste.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The illusion of academic meritocracy allows the caste system to continue
unchallenged even though it is almost entirely hereditary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That said, I really enjoyed my college days. I had a blast learning everything
I could, often at the expense of my school work. I still use some of what I
learned in my career today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>The Value of Bitcoin</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My goal here is to determine the value of bitcoin from first principles.
When I say bitcoin I am referring to the digital asset, not the underlying
technology, software, or protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will start with establishing what money is, and how bitcoin is like
money. Then I will describe how to determine the value of money and apply
that same process to bitcoin. Afterwards we’ll discuss what that means for
people who have bought or are considering buying bitcoin. And finally,
what this means for other blockchain currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-money&quot;&gt;What is money?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money, by definition, has three characteristics. It is a store of value,
a medium of exchange, and a unit of account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A unit of account is something that is useful to measure the value (or
cost) of other items. In the same way we use inches to measure length, we use
money, (like dollars) to measure value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A medium of exchange is something that is useful in trade. I write
software and eat bananas. It’s hard to trade bananas for software labor, so
instead I trade my labor for money, which I can then trade for bananas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A store of value is something that is useful because it can be saved and
it retains its value. Bananas are a poor thing to save. They take up a lot
of space and lose all their value after about a week. Money, in contrast,
is worth about the same as it was last week or month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;types-of-money&quot;&gt;Types of money&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money can be categorized into three different types, commodity money,
representative money, and fiat money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;commodity-money&quot;&gt;Commodity money&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A commodity is an economic good that is completely interchangeable.
A pound of coal is indistinguishable from every other pound of coal. An
ounce of copper is equal to every other ounce of copper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all commodities are suitable as money. Barrels of crude oil are too
heavy to carry to the store. Pork bellies rot if they are not kept frozen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold and silver are commodities that have been used as money throughout most of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;representative-currency&quot;&gt;Representative currency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that represents commodity money can be used as money in its
place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper is heavy and difficult to ship, so around 800 BC the Tang Dynasty
began to pay merchants with pieces of paper that could be exchanged for
copper in the capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As recently as 1933 the US Government created representative currency in the form of gold certificates. Each
certificate could be exchanged for a fixed amount of gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fiat-money&quot;&gt;Fiat money&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiat is Latin for “let it be done” and means an authoritative or arbitrary
order.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fiat-definition&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fiat-definition&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Fiat money is not an economic good like commodity
money, nor does it represent one like representative money. It is called fiat because something,
usually a government, declares it to be money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bitcoin-as-money&quot;&gt;Bitcoin as money&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing pace and geographic scope of trade has demanded
increasingly fast and efficient mediums of exchange. By now, most money
doesn’t exist as physical objects, but as accounts in computerized
ledgers. Instead of exchanging bills and coins we make debits and credits
with banks, credit card companies, and payment processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin works the same way, except instead of a private ledger held by
a trusted party, it uses a distributed ledger that can be verified by
anyone in the world. And instead of an account that is tied to some
identity, it use an address tied to a secret key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the ledger is distributed, transfers can be made without needed to trust
any third-party. Because there is no need to tie an account to an identity,
there is the potential for pseudo- or actual anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;underlying-value-of-money&quot;&gt;Underlying value of money&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;commodity-and-representative-money&quot;&gt;Commodity and representative money&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying value of commodity money comes from the utility that the
commodity provides. For instance, gold is extremely inert, malleable, and
conductive. Because of that there is a lot demand for it in electronics
and other uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representative currencies add a layer of indirection. The value of a gold
certificate is the same as the value of the gold it represents, plus the
value of the convenience the certificate provides, minus the cost of
converting it to gold and the risk of not being able to convert it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1800’s America banks were not permitted to have satellite branches, so
the value (and thus the price) of a gold certificate would decrease based
on its distance from the bank that issued it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fiat-money-1&quot;&gt;Fiat money&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of fiat money comes from the demands of the government that
supports it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Government has declared US Dollars to be legal tender, which
means that it is accepted for all debts, public charges, taxes, and
dues.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:USCsec5103&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:USCsec5103&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As long as the US government demands US dollars,
it has value to people who need to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, a government’s demand for their own currency could end at any
time. However, the benefits of being able to create your own money are so
great that as long as the government is capable of operating in its own
best interest it will maintain the value of its currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;secondary-demand-for-money&quot;&gt;Secondary demand for money&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the demand for money come from people who do not want it for its
underlying value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors don’t buy gold coins to make circuit boards. I want dollars so
I can pay taxes, but also so I can buy bananas from the grocer. The grocer
wants dollars so he can pay his suppliers and landlord and clerks. And
they all want dollars so they can buy a myriad of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even though much of the trade in dollars is not to immediately satisfy
the demand from the government, that demand is why the dollars have value
and why we are all willing to trade valuable things for them. If the
underlying demand disappears, the value of the dollar would disappear with
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see this every time a government falls. Once the government no longer
provides the underlying demand for its currency, nobody wants it and the
value of the currency drops to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-value-of-bitcoin&quot;&gt;The value of bitcoin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin does not have utility like a commodity money. It does not
represent a commodity with utility. And it does not have any
underlying source of demand like fiat money. Bitcoin has no value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is notwithstanding the amazing features of public blockchain
technologies. Fast and cheap transfers, facilitated without trusted
intermediaries, is worthless if the thing being transferred is worthless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;value-versus-price&quot;&gt;Value versus price&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until now I have written a lot about value but I haven’t talked about
price. The value of something is what it is worth. The price is what
people pay for it. This distinction makes it possible for me to say that
bitcoin has no value even though the current price is thousands of
dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;value-investing-versus-speculation&quot;&gt;Value investing versus speculation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Value investing is the process of identifying and purchasing assets that
are worth more than their price.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:intelligent-investor&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:intelligent-investor&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; When a value investor pays $70 to buy an
asset that is worth $100, they make $30 in profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because bitcoin has no value, it cannot be a value investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculation is the process of speculating on which assets people will pay more
for in the future and buying those assets with the intent of selling them
when the price goes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin’s meteoric rise in price has created astonishing returns for
speculators and it may continue to do so. Because the price is limited
only by what people believe other people will pay for bitcoin in the
future there is no limit to how high it can go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, like all speculative bubbles, the price of bitcoin is unstable.
A sufficiently large shock to the confidence of speculators that the price
will continue to go up will cause it to crash all the way to zero. Over
time the odds of such a shock happening approach 100%. Eventually the
price of bitcoin will fall to effectively zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it is impossible to identify when this crash will happen,
only that it will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to make a lot of money on speculation buy either being
lucky or predicting investor sentiment. There is no known way to reliably
and ethically generate either of those conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Groundbreaking for The Dream @ Tamarind South</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On October 15, 2017 I was offered the opportunity to say a few words at
the groundbreaking ceremony for The Dream @ Tamarind South, a 32-unit
building at 1310 Tamarind Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the remarks I prepared:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are over fifteen hundred people in Hollywood who are homeless.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Fifteen hundred men, women, and children; fifteen hundred of our neighbors
in this small community are without a safe place to sleep at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more of our neighbors are at risk of homelessness; housing in Los
Angeles is the most unaffordable in the country.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with projects like this one that we can increase the supply of housing
and mitigate the unaffordability crisis and homelessness crisis we are
facing in Hollywood and in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projects like the Dream at Tamarind are a key part of keeping Hollywood an
exciting, dynamic place where anyone can make it big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-unit buildings near job and transit centers allow lower-income
families to live here in Hollywood, a region with excellent job and career
prospects that are only getting better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It allows them to work at those jobs without the long car commutes that
cause smog, noise, traffic congestion, stress, time away from families,
and roadway death.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on behalf of myself, my neighborhood, and the community at large
I would like to thank the Strategic Legacy Investment Group and everyone
else that has been involved in bringing this project and projects like it
to Hollywood. Thank you, and we look forward many more.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Best Practices of the Hollywood Studio District Neighborhood Council</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-a-neighborhood-council&quot;&gt;What is a Neighborhood Council?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neighborhood councils are a group of representatives who volunteer to
serve as advisors to the city of Los Angeles on issues of concern to the
neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their purpose is “to promote more citizen participation in government and
make government responsible to local needs.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:IX-900&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:IX-900&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-the-hollywood-studio-district-neighborhood-council&quot;&gt;What is the Hollywood Studio District Neighborhood Council?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hollywood Studio District Neighborhood Council (HSDNC) is the
neighborhood council that represents the Hollywood Studio District of Los
Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hollywood Studio District is the area south of Hollywood Blvd, east of
El Centro Ave, North of Melrose, and west of Western Avenue or the
Hollywood freeway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information about the HSDNC can be found on their
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hsdnc.org/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-this-document&quot;&gt;What is this document?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document is my personal opinion on how best to operate the HSDNC,
based on my experience as a board member, committee chair, and board
chair, as well as my best understanding of the laws, rules, and
regulations governing neighborhood councils and the guidance offered by
the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment (DONE) and other city staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the things in this document will be specific to the HSDNC, but
I anticipate that much of it will useful to other neighborhood councils in
Los Angeles and maybe even to other small governmental or other
deliberative bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a living document, intended to be updated as things and my
understanding of them change. If you would like to recommend any
amendments, updates, or corrections please feel free to email me — or
better yet, open a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-this-document-is-not&quot;&gt;What this document is not&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document does not represent the policy, procedures, rules, or opinion
of the HSDNC, DONE, the City of Los Angeles, or any other organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document is not legal advice. I am not a lawyer. I am not your
lawyer. If you need a lawyer I believe I am required to advise you find
one licensed to practice law in your jurisdiction. If your neighborhood
council needs legal advice the city attorney’s office has an entire
division dedicated to providing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-you-want-the-hsdnc-to&quot;&gt;So you want the HSDNC to…&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to get the HSDNC to accomplish anything is to present it to
the board as a well-researched and complete action that the board can vote
to approve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the action would be recommended by a committee but if there is no
committee with relevant jurisdiction, or there is no time for the
committee to consider the item you can send it directly to the vice chair
and the executive committee will decide whether to include it on the board
agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-a-stance&quot;&gt;Take a stance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HSDNC can take a position on any item whatsoever, with very few
exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to format a statement of the council’s stance is as
a resolution. A resolution is a single statement consisting of a series of
“whereas” clauses describing the background and reasoning, and one or more
“resolved” clauses stating the position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example resolution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;WHEREAS it is valuable to have the background, reasoning, and
explanation of an action together in one statement; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;WHEREAS the format of resolutions make it easy to include and
distinguish the background, reasoning, and explanation from the decision
of the body; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;WHEREAS the resolution format is standardized and familiar to all
government officials; therefore be it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;RESOLVED that this writer recommends positions adopted by the HSDNC be
written as resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;communicate-their-stance-to-other-parts-of-city-government&quot;&gt;Communicate their stance to other parts of city government&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HSDNC is an advisory board to they city and as such can communicate
their positions to other parts of the city government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to communicate the HSDNC’s position to the city council is
via a Community Impact Statement (CIS). The community impact statement
process was created as a way for neighborhood councils to express their
support, opposition, or suggestions about any matter pending before the
city council, city council committees, or city commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a community impact statement is submitted in time, the NC’s position
will be printed on the agenda. The full statement becomes part of the
council file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At meetings where the item appears on the agenda, if the NC has filed
a CIS, a representative from the board will be given five minutes to speak
about the board stance on the matter. Speakers are usually given one to
two minutes for their comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to format a CIS is as a resolution like any other position
the board takes. However, it is very important with a CIS to be specific
about the relevant council file; the board stance (for, against, for if
amended, against if amended, no position, neutral position), and the
agency the statement is directed to (the city council, or a city
commission).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example resolution to submit a CIS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;WHEREAS the Congress of Neighborhood is very effective at promoting
citizen participation in government; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;WHEREAS the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment plans to hold the
Congress of Neighborhoods in the 4th floor media room, rotunda, Spring St.
forecourt, and south lawn in city hall on September 9th, 2017 from 6 am to
5 pm; therefore be it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;RESOLVED that the Hollywood Studio District Neighborhood Council is for
Council File 13-0378-S3, authorizing the use of the 4th floor media room,
rotunda, Spring St. forecourt, and south lawn in city hall on September
9th, 2017 from 6 am to 5 pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;communicate-their-stance-outside-the-city-government&quot;&gt;Communicate their stance outside the city government&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HSDNC cannot communicate their position to governments or governmental
agencies outside the city. The HSDNC, like all neighborhood councils, is
part of the government of the City of Los Angeles and within the City of
Los Angeles only the Mayor and the City Council have power over
intergovernmental relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spend-money-on-nc-operations&quot;&gt;Spend money on NC operations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each neighborhood council is given an annual budget currently amounting to
$47,000 per fiscal year. This money can be used for operations, outreach,
community improvement projects, and conducting NC elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--- ## Community improvement projects]] ---&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;give-money-to-an-organization-to-create-a-benefit-in-the-community&quot;&gt;Give money to an organization to create a benefit in the community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A portion of the NC’s budget can be used to provide grants to public
schools or 501(c)(3)’s to support a public purpose and benefit the
public-at-large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wish to apply for an Neighborhood Purpose Grant (NPG), the
application is available on the city clerk’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send the completed application, along with all supporting documentation to
the chair and treasurer. They will bring it to the executive committee
which will decide whether to put it on the board agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-call-meeting&quot;&gt;How to call meeting&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when&quot;&gt;When&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular meetings should be at the date and time set by the standing
meeting calendar. For the HSDNC board this is every second Monday at 6:30
pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special meetings can be called when necessary but should be avoided. It is
very difficult to find a date and time that all the  board or committee
members are available. Also, other stakeholders, who are familiar with the
standing meeting calendar, are less likely to be aware of a special
meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where&quot;&gt;Where&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meetings must be held within the boundaries of the NC.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:VIII-1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:VIII-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting locations must be open to the public.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:54961-a&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:54961-a&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting locations must be ADA compliant.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:54961-a:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:54961-a&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HSDNC has twenty board members and routinely sees 20 members of the
public at board meetings so board meeting locations should accommodate at
least 50 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Committees are typically much smaller and the meeting are less
well-attended so their venues can be smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-the-agenda&quot;&gt;Setting the agenda&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The board agenda is set by the executive committee.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:IIX-2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:IIX-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help ensure the best possible agenda and make the executive committee
meeting efficient, the chair should prepare a proposed agenda. The
executive committee can review each item individually to amend or remove
as they wish. Afterwards, the committee can decide to add any agenda items
that were not on the chair’s proposed agenda. And finally they can discuss
changing the order of agenda items as they see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to create an agenda is to start with a duplicate of the
previous month’s agenda. Change the date on the first page and in the
footer, remove the items that don’t happen every month, and update the
dates for the minutes and MER that need to be approved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chair should create a proposed agenda for the next meeting as soon as
the current agenda is finalized. This makes it easy to add items as soon
as they are brought to the chair’s attention instead of trying to gather
them all together immediately before the executive committee meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is best to err on the side of including an item on the chair’s proposed
agenda even if there are good reasons for it not to be on the board
agenda. It is easy to remove an item from the proposed agenda. It is
difficult to remember to discuss an item that is not on the proposed
agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Committee agendas are set by the committee chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agenda items should contain enough detail to provide sufficient notice to
a reasonable person about the action the board is contemplating. If the
board is taking a position or submitting a community impact statement, the
entire resolution should be included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;posting-the-agenda&quot;&gt;Posting the agenda&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All HSDNC agendas need to be posted via the city’s Early Notification
System (ENS), physically at the Lemon Grove park, and on the HSDNC
website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To post the agenda via ENS send the agenda as a PDF to NC support with the
date and title of the meeting in the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To post the agenda at Lemon Grove park you can go there yourself, or email
the recreation coordinator and ask them to post it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To post the agenda on the website add an event to the meetings calendar
on NationBuilder and upload the agenda to it as a PDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agendas should also be sent to the HSDNC mailing list on NationBuilder. Board
agendas should be sent to all supporters. Committee agendas should be sent to
people who are interested in that committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;paper-copies&quot;&gt;Paper copies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the board meeting, board members are going to need the agenda, the
minutes of the previous meeting, the previous month’s MER, and possibly
other materials. Distributing these items individually is time-consuming
and disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meetings go smoother if every board member is given a packet of the
materials they need before the meeting begins. For ease of use, put the
agenda first, and the rest of the materials in the order they will be
needed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tree Specs vs. Exception Specs</title>
        <description>&lt;!-- 
Ignore this implementation of the post class. It's only here so we can run
the specs in this file using a magic incantation like this: 

```sh

sed -n '/^```/,/^```/ p' &lt; _drafts/exception-spec-versus-tree-specs.md | sed '/^```/ d' | rspec /dev/stdin

```

```ruby
class Post
  attr_accessor :published_at
  attr_accessor :editor_approved
  attr_accessor :translated

  def initialize(published_at: nil, editor_approved: false, translated: false)
    @published_at = published_at
    @editor_approved = editor_approved
    @translated = translated
  end

  def editable?
    !published_at &amp;&amp; !editor_approved &amp;&amp; !translated
  end
end
```
 --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of fighting, the zombies have been contained and now it’s time
to rebuild civilization. Everyone has a particular job to do in this
technological reboot and yours is to write a blog platform. It could be
worse. Someone is out there inspecting septic tank interiors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your post-apocalyptic project manager used to be a newspaper editor and as
such he’s a stickler for some journalism best practices. For instance, he
wants to make sure that posts cannot be edited after they have been
published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you write this spec:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;RSpec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;#editable?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the post is published&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;published_at: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;utc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;not_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the post is not published&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;published_at: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the cataclysm, your PM was a bit of a control freak. He almost
burst a blood vessel when a writer changed an article that he had already
approved. He wants to make sure that cannot happen in your new blog
platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you modify your specs to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;RSpec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;#editable?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;published_at: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;published_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;editor_approved: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;editor_approved&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the post is published&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:published_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;utc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the editor has approved&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:editor_approved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;not_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the editor has not approved&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:editor_approved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;not_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the post is not published&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;not_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the editor has not approved&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:editor_approved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newspaper industry was struggling even before the end of the world as
we knew it and your PM knows how important it is to pinch pennies. To
avoid paying translators more than once for the same article he wants to
make sure that no one changes an article after it has been translated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you modify your spec again. Now it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;RSpec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;#editable?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;published_at: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;published_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;editor_approved: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;editor_approved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;translated: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;translated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the post is published&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:published_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;utc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the editor has approved&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the post has been translated&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:translated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;not_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the post has not been translated&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:translated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;not_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the post has not been translated&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is spec is starting to get pretty long and hard to follow. And being
the sort of engineer who is smart enough to survive a zombie apocalypse
you can see that the spec doubles in size every time a new condition is
added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not tenable. Let’s rewind and see if we can find a better way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the translation requirement, the spec looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;RSpec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;#editable?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;published_at: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;published_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;editor_approved: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;editor_approved&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the post is published&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:published_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;utc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the editor has approved&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:editor_approved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;not_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the editor has not approved&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:editor_approved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;not_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the post is not published&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:published_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the editor has approved&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:editor_approved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;not_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the editor has not approved&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:editor_approved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specification is structured like a binary tree with an expectation at
each terminal leaf. Every condition we add adds another level to the tree,
doubles the number of terminal leaves, and doubles the number of
expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason you’ve survived this long is your ability to tell
humans apart from zombies. When you apply the same pattern-matching skills
to this spec you notice one of the expectations is different from all of
the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one situation the post is editable. All the other specs are exceptions
to that situation. When you re-factor the specs to reflect that they look
more like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;RSpec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;#editable?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;published_at: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;published_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;editor_approved: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;editor_approved&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:published_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:editor_approved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the post is published&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:published_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;utc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;not_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the editor has approved&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:editor_approved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;not_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spec is now more concise, easier to read, and easier to modify. When
you add the translation requirement it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;RSpec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;#editable?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;published_at: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;published_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;editor_approved: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;editor_approved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;translated: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;translated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:published_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:editor_approved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:translated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the post is published&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:published_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;utc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;not_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the editor has approved&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:editor_approved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;not_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;when the post has been translated&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:translated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;not_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_editable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your objects have one normal case and a series of exceptions it makes
sense to organize your specs that way. They will be shorter, clearer,
easier to understand, and easier to modify; exactly what you will need
them to be in order to thrive in the post-zombie apocalypse world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;fun-run&quot;&gt;Fun Run&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m the guy running the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6xyoKnpKl_8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s pretty obvious that I am not someone who would, or should be
running marathons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a really fun shoot. They shut down a street downtown and I ran back and
forth all morning. The sweat is fake, but the exhaustion is real.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Types of Specifications</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-specification&quot;&gt;What is a specification?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we can talk about specifications we have to know what they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specification is a noun, derived from the verb to specify. To specify is to
state explicitly or in detail. Therefore a specification is the result of
stating explicitly or in detail, or something that states explicitly or in
detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every software team has their own unique points of view, cultural wisdom, and
shared practices regarding specifications but they can be grouped into a few
categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-specifications&quot;&gt;No specifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have have specifications, that’s too much overhead. That’s fine if
you’re at NASA or Chase but we’re a lean mean startup that has to add features
fast.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What feature are you working on now?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m adding a subscription option that gives users a regular allotment of
credits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s a specification.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not possible to have no specifications. If you don’t know what a method
does how could you possibly know how to write it? If you don’t know what your
application is supposed to do, how do you make it do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implicit-specifications&quot;&gt;Implicit specifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, we know what the software is doing, but it’s not like we have any actual
specification document.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You have implicit specifications.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An implicit specification is any specification that doesn’t exist outside of
someone’s head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implicit specifications have a lot of upsides. They are very easy to create,
springing into existence with no little or no effort. They are equally easy to
change, as fluid as thought itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This flexibility is also the downside of implicit specifications. When the
behavior changes constantly and without warning it is very difficult to
effectively use the software. When the specification changes constantly it’s
difficult to write code that meets the it; you are trying to hit a moving
target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large, complicated, or confusing specifications exasperate the problem. When
implicit, these specifications change for no other reason than it is not
possible to maintain them completely in working memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping specifications implicit also makes it easy to overlook problems such as
ambiguity, incompleteness, or inconsistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, implicit specifications are impossible to communicate. To express them
in language is to make them explicit. If the communication is not captured,
for example a water-cooler conversation, then the explicit specification is lost
forever and what you have left is multiple implicit specifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plain-english-specification&quot;&gt;Plain English specification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In order to avoid those type of confusions we write our specs down.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What spec are you working on implementing now?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll read it to you, ‘Ensure subscribers each have 100 credits biweekly.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plain English specification is a specification written in plain English.[0]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the curious characteristics of English is that it is ambiguous and
imprecise. For example, does this happens twice a week or every two weeks? Do
subscribers get their credit balance set to a total of 100 no matter what the
previous value was or is it incremented 100 more than the previous balance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;legalese-specifications&quot;&gt;Legalese specifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We work very hard to avoid ambiguity in our specs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh? What spec are you working on now?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It says, ‘Whereas a user has paid a monthly subscription fee, when the month or
mid-month period has ended, and the subscriber has at least – ’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”– never mind.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliminating ambiguities and ensuring precision in language is the same work a
lawyer does when writing a contract or other legal document. The outcomes are
are also very similar. I call these legalese specifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even for experts, writing and reading legalese takes considerable effort. And
after all their training, experience, expertise, and effort, the existence of
courts demonstrates that legalese is still not always as precise or unambiguous
as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;executable-specifications&quot;&gt;Executable specifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An executable specification is computer code that specifies how another computer
program works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executable specifications are precise and unambiguous by their nature as
computer code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executable specifications are very useful to keep for regression testing. A
computer can test your application in seconds or minutes against a specification
that a human would spend days or weeks on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t actually do without specifications. My recommendation is that you
write them down and that you write them as computer code. Executable software is
the only effective way to describe the behavior of executable software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write your specifications, in executable software, and then use that software to
drive your development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call it specification-driven development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[0] Everything I say about plain English specifications is most likely true
about specifications written in any natural language.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>No Fly, No Buy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Senator Collins (Maine) has proposed the “Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act of
2016”.  The full text of the act is not available, but there is a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collins.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Terrorist%20Firearms%20Prevention%20Act%20of%202016%20One-Pager.pdf&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt;.
In an attempt to prevent terrorists from using guns the bill would make it
illegal for anyone on the “No Fly” list to purchase a firearm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most Americans, I believe that the rights protected by the Second Amendment
are not absolute and that terrorists should not be allowed to purchase firearms
in the United States. For this reason, I support Sen. Collins’ proposal
with a couple of necessary, common-sense adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the process for adding and removing people on the “No Fly” list needs to
be clear, transparent, and completely objective. When we are denying people
their fundamental and Constitutionally-guaranteed rights, it is important that
the process be completely transparent and objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, additions to the “No Fly” list should not be done in secret. Before we
restrict the fundamental and Constitutionally-guaranteed rights of anyone, they
should have the opportunity to examine the evidence against them and mount a
defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, no one should be added to the “No Fly” list for anything less than a
violation of the law. It is fundamentally incompatible with the rule of law to
deny people their rights on the basis of suspicion or association. No one should
be added to the “No Fly” list without first being convicted of a crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, persons who have been convicted of a crime and added to the “No Fly”
list should be removed from those lists when they have finished their sentence
and are released back into the public. If the criminal justice system has
determined that this person is no longer a threat to the public then there is
no need to continue to restrict their rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sen. Collins’ proposal has none of these safeguards which makes it not only
incompatible with the Constitution, but, worse, an assault on due process, rule
of law, and the fundamental rights of people who have never been convicted or
even charged with a crime.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Specifications not Test</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Stop writing tests. I want you to stop writing tests for your code. Stop writing
tests and start writing specifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;judgement&quot;&gt;Judgement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests render judgement. You can fail a test. And if you fail a test what does
that make you? A failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifications do not render judgement. You can confirm to a specification or
you can not confirm to a specification. That is a choice you get to make. If you
are writing an email server, you will probably want to confirm the IMAP
specification. If you are writing a first-person shooter you probably won’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chronology&quot;&gt;Chronology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests come after the fact. You learn fractions, and then you take a test. You
build a car, and then you crash-test it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifications come first. Before you build anything you need to first identify
what you are building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optionality&quot;&gt;Optionality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests are optional. You can test the waters, or you can just dive in. You can
take a blood test, or you can assume you’re fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifications are not optional. If you don’t specify what it does, how do you
know you are done writing it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;naming&quot;&gt;Naming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may already be writing specifications but calling them tests. Call them
specifications. Names are important. If you don’t believe that, rename all of
your variables and methods by drawing letters from a bag of Scrabble tiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Random names are still far better than names that are misleading.  Calling a
specification a test is like calling a saddle a seat. The distinction is subtle
but very important. If you treat a saddle like a seat after a few miles your
butt is going to hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it comes before the application code, is necessary, and isn’t used to judge
developers then you are not writing tests, you are writing specifications. Call
them that. If your specifications are used to drive the application development,
then you are doing specification-driven development. Call it that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea for this essay originated in a Twitter
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ExMember/status/471745713764712450&quot;&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dbrady&quot;&gt;Dave Brady&lt;/a&gt;. It was further expanded for a lighting
talk I gave at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andconf.io/&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;:conf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
