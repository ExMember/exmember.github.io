<p>“Waking from the Dream” closed over a week ago, but I’m only just now
recovering. Now is a great time to thank, Barika Croom my co-star, the Velma in
“Velma and Manny”; our director Carolyn Blais; writer and producer Rochelle
Perry; and producer Anne Mesa; and the rest of the cast and crew.</p>

<p>Thank you. You were amazing!</p>

<p>In appreciation, I will restrain myself from making another pun on the title.</p>
