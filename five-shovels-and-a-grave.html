<p>AQ in middle position with a $5 limper. I make it $25 and get two callers
behind.</p>

<p>The flop is 945, all spades. We check to the middle position caller who doesn’t
hesitate and bets $201. It’s folded back around to me.</p>

<p>The bettor is a old Asian man with his wife sweating him. I have him pegged as a
gambler already. He bet very quickly, forcefully even. Everything about him is
showing strength, and that’s intentional. This is classic bluff behavior.</p>

<p>At the same time he’s bet $200 into a $75 pot. That’s a lot of money to risk on
a bluff. But why would he bet so much if he wanted a call?</p>

<p>I’m convinced he doesn’t want anyone to call. Even if I’m wrong, and he has a
hand, say a set of nines, I’ve got the aces of spades, so I have lots of outs.</p>

<p>I call. The turn is a 3s and I make the flush. The river is a Js, just to rub it
it.</p>

<p>The Asian man looks at his cards for a second before turning them over. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2s6</code>.
He has a straight flush.</p>
