<p>Last Saturday I got to spend the day on a University of Phoenix campus shooting
a commercial for them. We expect it to start airing in August so be on the
lookout for that.</p>

<p>In the meantime, my Charter commercial is currently airing. If you live in a
Charter service air, look for me. I am the first delivery guy out of the truck.
Let me know if you see it.</p>
