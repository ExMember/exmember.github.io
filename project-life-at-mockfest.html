<p>“Project: Life” will be screened during the fourth annual Mockfest, November
12-14 at the Raleigh Studios in Hollywood.</p>

<p>Finally, a chance to see this beautiful and hilarious film on the big screen.
You won’t see me in the film, I’m the disembodied voice narrating, but I hope to
be at the festival.</p>

<p>I’ll post more information about date, time, and ticket prices as I get it. For
