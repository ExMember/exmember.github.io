<p>I’ve finally managed to post a short clip from “Project: Life,” a brilliant
mockumentary I narrated a couple of years ago. See the clip and then go learn
more about <a href="http://projectlifemovie.com">the movie</a>. Beg them to sell you DVD’s.
You’re going to want to see this.</p>

<p>Update: You can actually see the whole movie on Youtube. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KluTIX4m520&amp;hd=1">Part 1</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkzA0ZJ01Rk&amp;hd=1">Part 2</a></p>
