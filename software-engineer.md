Computers are the most powerful tools in the history of mankind and we have only begun to scratch the surface of what they can do. I am always looking for ways to improve lives and computer software is a fertile field for that.

Over a quarter-century of hands-on work gives me extensive practical knowledge and skills. My MIT education, where I earned a degree in computer science, gives me a broad and solid understanding of the fundamental science involved.

I've developed firmware, desktop applications, and web-based applications. I have built two different companies based on software I wrote and I am currently working on my first hand-held application.
