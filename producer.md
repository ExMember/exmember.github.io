I produced the award-winning and critically-acclaimed hit ["Pulp Shakespeare"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffkeYdpjaIs) which played to full houses in Los Angeles for eleven weeks.

During the 2012-2013 season I was the field producer for the World Series of Poker Circuit final table broadcasts on ESPN. Over the course of six months we went to thirteen different locations in eleven states (and one Canadian province) creating as-live broadcast of tournaments finales.
