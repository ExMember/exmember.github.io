# Entrepreneur

As an entrepreneur,
I seek to provide
significant benefit
to my customers
and the world around us
in a way
that is profitable
and sustainable.

I focus on
web-based,
software-as-a-service
applications.
Out of every available
computing platform
the web
is the fastest
for building and distributing
on software.
Web-based software
can iterate faster
than software
on any other platform.

        rules, and regulations that govern Los Angeles Neighborhood
        Councils so they can spend more of their time making government
        more responsive to local needs.
