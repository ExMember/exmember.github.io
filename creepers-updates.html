<p>If you are in Atlanta this weekend you are in the right place for the
Dragon*Con Independent Film Festival(https://filmfest.dragoncon.org/) where you
can see me in the short film “Creepers”.</p>

<p>Producers CJ Johnson and Genevieve Wheeler will be there doing Q &amp; A so you can
ask them how they got me to run around a grocery store pointing a handgun at
things I’ll give you a hint, it wasn’t hard.</p>

<p>If you aren’t in Atlanta don’t panic. “Creepers” will be making it’s West Coast
debut soon.</p>
