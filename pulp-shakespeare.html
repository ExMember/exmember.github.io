<p>Ever wonder what would Pulp Fiction be like if it were written by William
Shakespeare? Someone did. And it’s pretty awesome.</p>

<p>I’ve agreed to stage manage the West Coast premiere of “Pulp Shakespeare; or, A
Slurry Tale” at the Hollywood Fringe Festival.</p>

<p>Our little merry band, Her Majesty’s Secret Player is in need of patronage.
