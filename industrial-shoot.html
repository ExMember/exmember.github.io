<p>Here’s a picture of me on the set of an
ethics training video I shoot this weekend. That’s Greg taking the camera away
giving us only enough time to take one shot at the photo. Thank Tess for making
me look so good, first by doing my makeup, then by managing to take this picture
under stress and with an unfamiliar cell-phone camera.</p>
