title: Hypnotist

A multi-year quest to understand human behavior from several different directions led me to hypnosis. In an effort to fully internalize what hypnosis had to teach me I sought out a course that would train me as a practitioner. In this way I could observe, understand, and experience hypnosis.

I trained with Mary Elizabeth Raines at the Academy for Professional Hypnosis Training were I was certified as a Clinical Hypnotherapist and granted entry to the National Guild of Hypnotists.
