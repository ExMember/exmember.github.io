          <h1>Day Nine: Home Again</h1>
        
        <p>14 hours, +$633</p>

<p>After some time off recovering from my trip I’m back into my home LA card room.
It’s good to be home.</p>

<p>I started out at a nitty table and stayed there way too long. I’ve said it
before, and I’ll say it again, table selection is the most important decision in
poker.</p>

<p>Our table was rarely full, but I still managed to escape to the table right
behind me and sit immediately behind a very obnoxious young drunk with over
$3000 in chips. Half the stacks at the table were over $800, and the chips were
flying.</p>

<p>The cards were not cooperating. As far as I can tell I played brilliantly in a
lot of ways.</p>

<p>My number one mistake was paying too much pre-flop to play speculative hands,
especially out of position. Even though I was very likely to get paid off if any
of them hit, when you have a $300 stack there aren’t a lot of speculative hands
that are worth $20 or $30 pre-flop.</p>

<p>Another possible problem was being too tight post flop. But when all I have is
AK or KQ and player who will play nearly anything are making big bets I don’t
want to commit there. I could be up against J-high, I’d seen it happen plenty.
But given that they weren’t playing completely randomly (at least not all the
time,) I always folded.</p>

<p>For the next few hours I mostly celebrated losing minimal amounts. I could have
easily been stacked several times, but I made the right reads over and over
again. Money saved is just as valuable as money won, and I would have lost at
least $600 if I ignored my reads and stuck my money in every time I had a great
hand.</p>

<p>The drunk got kicked out (he’d already been banned on a previous visit) and the
table broke.</p>

<p>I got moved to what looked like a very soft table, with very deep stacks. Again,
five stacks of $1000 plus each, and me with $800 due to a lucky hand just before
moving. It was 3am but I had to give this a shot.</p>

<p>A new drunk showed up, with a homeless man he claimed was his brother
rail-birding him and fetching him cans of beer from somewhere, despite the fact
that it was well past last call.</p>

<p>I treaded water for a few hours, then in won several very large pots in rapid
succession. Now that the drunk was busted the table was not longer profitable so
I packed up and left, turning a cold decked night into a decent profit.</p>
