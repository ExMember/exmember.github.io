<p>“Gambler’s Anonymous” is a story of addiction, consequences, and gambling at the
highest possible stakes. We shot in August of last year but it took a long time
to finish the post production work.</p>

<p>The script was awesome, the cast and crew were awesome, and I knew the movie was
going to be awesome. After ten months of waiting I finally have a copy, and I
was right.</p>

<p>It’s going out to a couple of film festivals now, so hopefully I can tell you
where to go see it soon. In the meantime I’ll see if I can post a clip here on
my website.</p>
