<p>I’m on the radio!</p>

<p>It’s actually not on the radio –it’s actually not anywhere at the moment. But
it is a radio play I recorded with Tsunami Radio Theater.</p>

<p>It’s called “Pax Romana” and it’s a very ambitious history set at the peak of
the Roman empire. It was also a lot of fun to work on. The cast was very large
and very talented.</p>

<p>I’ll post a link as soon as the final product is available.</p>
