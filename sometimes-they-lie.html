<p>I was pretty sure he was bluffing, but there wasn’t anything I could do about
it.</p>

<p>I had leverage working against me. If I called $200 here I was going to be
facing another $200 bet on the river. I had a very weak-hand, AK. Without a
pair, I could still lose to a bluff.</p>

<p>The worst part was that if he was bluffing he had called my pre-flop raise and
continuation bet for the singular purpose of setting up the bluff. It would be a
much more sophisticated play that I expected from him.</p>

<p>I decided to concede, but first was giving him a little Hollywood action, so he
wouldn’t know I had such a weak hand.</p>

<p>“I’m going to do it, but it’s really hard for me to lay this hand down.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, he came to life. “Throw it away. I’ve got you beat.”</p>

<p>He was going to be a nice guy to me and let me off the hook easy. If I had
stopped to think I might have held on to my cards.</p>

<p>This guy was not a nice guy. He played for ego. He played to show you he was
better than you because he could risk more, and win more than you. Why would he
be a nice guy here?</p>

<p>Sure enough, as soon as my hand hit the muck he turned over 24o.</p>

<p>I was impressed. And annoyed.</p>

<p>That pot was the start of a massive rush for him and an hour later he was
racking up a thousand dollar win. Of course not before taking a photo of his
massive stack and repeated exclaiming to everyone and no one in particular, “I
make cheddar! Cheddar don’t make me!”</p>
