<p>I am starring in The Resurrection by W. B. Yeats opening this weekend. This is a
very short, but extremely challenging, lesser-known one-act by one of the great
writers of the last century. It has been very exciting to work on and I
guarantee the show will be unique and worthwhile.</p>

<p>If you’d like to come see it, we are running from March 28th through April 6th,
Fridays and Saturdays at 7:30pm, and Sundays at 4:00pm at the First Presbyterian
Church of Santa Monica, <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=1220+Second+Street,+Santa+Monica+CA,+90401&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl">1220 Second Street, Santa Monica CA,
90401</a>.
Tickets are $10 “or donation” and there is plenty of public parking nearby, as
well as pubs where we can drink off the weight of the show afterwards.</p>
