<p>This summer I will be in Cymbeline and  A Midsummer Night’s Dream at Will Geer’s
Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga.</p>

<p>The Theatricum Botanicum is an outdoor theater with a huge stage integrated with
the surrounding woods and trails. It is the only stage I have ever seen that is
suitable for performing Shakespeare, so it’s quite a treat to be a part of the
company.</p>

<p>We perform for our first school group on Monday April 27 but don’t open for the
public until Sunday May 31.</p>

<p>All the details on at <a href="https://theatricum.com">Theatricum.com</a>. Come and see us!</p>
