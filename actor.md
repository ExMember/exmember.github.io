title: Actor

I have been acting for over quarter-century and have appeared in theater, television, movies, and commercials.

Acting plays a big part in making me the person I am. At first it fulfilled a simple desire for attention I couldn't get other ways. But later it forced me to confront who I really am and to expose that raw vulnerable side we all have but keep hidden and protected by our social masks. When we suffer to expose that hidden side of us on stage and then survive the experience, we grow powerful. We have faced our deepest fear and survived. Surely there is nothing that can harm us.
