<p>My non-MTV-watching self did not know that this video had been out for quite
sometime. I found the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9QE_pG0VDg">video</a> on
YouTube. Three minutes and five seconds in you can see me on the right hand side
of the star quarterback and antagonist. (His right, not yours)</p>

<p>I’m also visible chasing and being chased by cheerleaders in the ensueing chaos,
but it’s impossible to recognize me.</p>
