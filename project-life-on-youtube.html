<p>I’ve already talked about how much I love this film, but it hasn’t been widely
screened until now. Now you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KluTIX4m520&amp;hd=1">“Project: Life” on
YouTube</a>. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkzA0ZJ01Rk&amp;hd=1">second

trailer</a>.</p>
