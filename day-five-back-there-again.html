<p>4 hours. +$950.</p>

<p>If you play well and get good cards, sometimes things like this will happen.</p>

<p>Looking back over the past week of posts, focus appears to be the – well, focus
of my efforts. The same is true today.</p>

<p>Nearly every time I sit down, I know more about how to play poker than all of
the other eight players. I say that with complete confidence, and also without
any pride.</p>

<p>Because how much I know and how much I’ve studied means absolutely nothing when
my less educated opponents play better than me. And that happens a lot.</p>

<p>Today my level of focus was high, but inconsistent. I continue to learn how much
information can be gained from the play of a hand, even if it doesn’t go to
showdown. I also continue to phase out for a lot of hands and parts of hands.
The amount of information available to me that I let go by unobserved is
astonishing.</p>

<p>A good run of cards, and a lots of really poor play by my opponents combined to
make this a great day. My opponents were destroyed mostly by a willingness to
play big pots when they shouldn’t and very wide pre-flop ranges.</p>

<p>As always, I had trouble focusing, which limited the amount of information I had
to work with. But within that limitation, I made extremely few errors. My bluffs
that were called were absolutely correct, given the situation and the
information I had. The bluffs that I folded to (quite a few, in fact) were all
correct folds given the situation. I knew when to value bet AT or AJ, when to
fold AQ, and when to check to induce a bluff.</p>

<p>I only know of one expensive mistake, when I misplayed a flopped straight with
T8o. That probably cost me $150.</p>

<p>All in all, I played better than usual, against opponents who were worse than
usual, and got cards that were better than usual. So a $950 upswing is not
unreasonable.</p>

<p>I’m looking to play better than this on a regular basis, and if I can, against
the same caliber players. That should generate a nice change in my results.</p>
