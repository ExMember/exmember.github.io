<p>“Project: Life” is finished. I have it on DVD. I have seen it, and it is
awesome.</p>

<p>It was a very long wait for this, but it was worth it. This is a top-notch film
in every way, hilarious throughout, and even more so on the second and third
viewings.</p>

<p>I narrate the film and hopefully I’ll have a clip up here for you at some point.</p>
