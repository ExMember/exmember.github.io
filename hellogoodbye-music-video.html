<p>Just shot a music video for <a href="https://www.hellogoodbye.net/">Hellogoodbye</a>’s hit
song “Baby it’s a Fact”.</p>

<p>It was an all-night shoot, but I had about as much fun as a person can have
while working from five-thirty pm to five am.</p>

<p>You might see me in detention, pushing/pulling the chalkboard in the the
foreground. I’m also one of the football players, number 84.</p>

<p>I expect it’ll show up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hellogoodbyevideos">YouTube</a>
at some point.  Let me know if you see it on TV or someplace else.</p>
