<p>Kam Miller’s short Fast Pitch arrived in the mail this week and it is fabulous.
The entire cast is phenomenal as screenwriters each with their own extreme
quirk. Barbara Stepansky’s quick editing doesn’t let a single dull moment creep
into in the ten minute film.</p>

<p>This piece is going to feature prominently in my upcoming reel. Look for that
soon.</p>
