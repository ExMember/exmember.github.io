<p>Senator Collins (Maine) has proposed the “Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act of
2016”.  The full text of the act is not available, but there is a
<a href="https://www.collins.senate.gov/sites/default/files/Terrorist%20Firearms%20Prevention%20Act%20of%202016.pdf">summary</a>.
In an attempt to prevent terrorists from using guns the bill would make it
illegal for anyone on the “No Fly” list to purchase a firearm.</p>

<p>Like most Americans, I believe that the rights protected by the Second Amendment
are not absolute and that terrorists should not be allowed to purchase firearms
in the United States. For this reason, I support Sen. Collins’ proposal
with a couple of necessary, common-sense adjustments.</p>

<p>First, the process for adding and removing people on the “No Fly” list needs to
be clear, transparent, and completely objective. When we are denying people
their fundamental and Constitutionally-guaranteed rights, it is important that
the process be completely transparent and objective.</p>

<p>Secondly, additions to the “No Fly” list should not be done in secret. Before we
restrict the fundamental and Constitutionally-guaranteed rights of anyone, they
should have the opportunity to examine the evidence against them and mount a
defense.</p>

<p>Thirdly, no one should be added to the “No Fly” list for anything less than a
violation of the law. It is fundamentally incompatible with the rule of law to
deny people their rights on the basis of suspicion or association. No one should
be added to the “No Fly” list without first being convicted of a crime.</p>

<p>Finally, persons who have been convicted of a crime and added to the “No Fly”
list should be removed from those lists when they have finished their sentence
and are released back into the public. If the criminal justice system has
determined that this person is no longer a threat to the public then there is
no need to continue to restrict their rights.</p>

<p>Sen. Collins’ proposal has none of these safeguards which makes it not only
incompatible with the Constitution, but, worse, an assault on due process, rule
of law, and the fundamental rights of people who have never been convicted or
even charged with a crime.</p>
