<p>I open for $6 from the cutoff with black sixes. The small blind, another
loose-passive player calls. The flop is a</p>
<ol>
  <li>I bet $10 and he calls. This means nothing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Turn is a Q, completely irrelevant. I bet $26, but the loose-passive player
min-check-raises me to $52.</p>

<p>I should probably give some thought here to what he has. A minimum checkraise
from a passive player means something. I probably would have figured it out if I
thought about it. But I didn’t think about it. I had bottom set against a loose
player, so I raised his last $93.</p>

<p>The possible hands for the villain here are 8T for the flopped straight, a
flopped overset (77 or 99), any two pair (flopped or turned), and maybe JT for
the straight draw. Only 77, 99, and JT are reasonable preflop calls, but this
guy can call with anything.</p>

<p>In this case he has the least likely possibility, 69o. A nine comes on the
river.</p>

<p>Bad beat: -160.</p>
