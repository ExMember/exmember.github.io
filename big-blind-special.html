<p>There is a min-raise from middle position. The small-blind calls. I make a very
loose call with 62o in the big blind.</p>

<p>The flop is exactly what I was hoping for, J22.</p>

<p>I check and it’s checked around.</p>

<p>The turn is a K. I don’t want to risk another diamond, so I bet $8 and hope
someone has a king. Middle position calls.</p>

<p>The river is a 4. I bet $18 this time, and middle position raises all-in $49
more.</p>

<p>I have to call $49 to win $110. Nothing makes sense here. I think he has a 2,
but if he does he gave two chances for the diamond to come and kill his action
if not take his pot.</p>

<p>Pocket fours is an unlikely call on the turn, especially since he didn’t bet the
flop.</p>

<p>Pocket jacks is unlikely all around.</p>

<p>K4 is possible, although it’s a strange hand to min-open-raise with.</p>

<p>I call. He has A2s. I really don’t know if I could ever fold in that situation.
I do know I should avoid that situation.</p>
