title: Poker Player

I started playing poker around 2004 and immediately saw it as a fascinating puzzle with lots of complicated pieces.

Over the next few years it became a past-time and then an interesting subject to study. Eventually I learned enough and developed the skill to win consistently. In 2006 income from poker gave me the confidence to quit my job.

I've been a professional poker player ever since and currently specialize in live mid-stakes no-limit hold'em cash games.
