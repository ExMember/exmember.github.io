# About Me

![](/images/about-me/actor.jpg)

I started working on Internet startups in 1999 and never stopped. I have been an
engineer, founder, consultant, CTO, and product manager.

Outside of tech, I am certified in ontological coaching, hypnosis, and
neuro-linguistic programming. I spent several years as professional poker
player, and have performed as an actor in theatre, commercials, network
television, and film.

I am the co-creator of [EarlyWords](https://www.earlywords.io) a tool to support
people on their creative recovery and am the creator of
[Neverbust](https://neverbust.com), the bankroll manager for professional poker
players. I offer coaching and consulting for software startups at [Talaria
Software](https://talariasoftware.com).
