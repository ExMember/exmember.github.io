# About Me

I started working
on Internet startups
in 1999
and never stopped.
I have been
an engineer, founder, consultant, CTO, product manager, and [speaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rudQgpOhQ04).
I offer coaching and consulting
for software startups
at [Talaria Software](https://talariasoftware.com).


I am the creator
of [USWDS Components](https://github.com/TalariaSoftware/uswds_components),
the open-source [ViewComponent](https://viewcomponent.org) library
for adding components
from the [US Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov)
to your Rails application.

In May 2020,
I teamed up
with Rob Head
to create [52 Sketches](https://52sketches.com).
Together,
and now with Claudia Alick,
we built [EarlyWords](https://www.earlywords.io),
a tool
to help
people unleash
their creativity.

In 2020,
I worked with
Marcus Detry
to create
[All In Blitz](https://www.allinblitz.com),
the first ever
college-football fantasy-conference game.

In 2017,
I developed
the first
rigorous and comprehensive
mathematical solution
to bankroll management.
That's when
I created [Neverbust](https://neverbust.com),
the bankroll manager
for professional poker players.

I am certified
in ontological coaching, hypnosis, and neuro-linguistic programming.
I spent seven years
as professional poker player.

As an actor,
I have performed
in theatre, commercials, network television, and film.
You may have seen me
in commercials
for [Safe Auto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNudyDtpBwQ),
[Evolve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le1BXo1To1s&list=PLMNiu3ZUfHHt6LbpN12oqZ2lxTgnNo_pf&index=7),
[Morgan and Morgan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OPQ0U6VZ-I)
or as the narrator
for [Project Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KluTIX4m520).
