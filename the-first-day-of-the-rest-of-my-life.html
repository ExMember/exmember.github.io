<p>322 hands. 1.55 hours. -$15.15</p>

<p>I’m back after a twenty-seven day tilt-induced hiatus. I’ve turned over a new
leaf, I’m determined to be more disciplined, and more focused. Yet already I
hate poker again.</p>

<p>But that’s the tilt-demon talking and I don’t have to listen to him. I know how
to beat the tilt demon now. We’ll cover that in another post and another time.</p>

<p>Lots of interesting things happened in the past 90 minutes. Hopefully I’ll get a
chance later today to do some post-mortem on the session and learn some
interesting things. For now I have to limit myself to some overview.</p>

<p>I played three tables total.  At the first one I played 147 hands winning $390.
At the second one, mostly simultaneously, I played 87 hands, and lost $381. At
the third table I played 51 hands, and despite not getting any hands managed to
lose $24.</p>

<p>Over the course of 93 minutes, the difference between the two tables was $771.
Both tables were soft. I was same player, playing both at the same time. Yet on
one I managed a big win and the other a big loss. Somehow I feel like that
should convince me there is a lot about this game that is out of my hands.</p>

<p>Just like no-limit poker is dominated by big runs, it’s also dominated by big
pots. I won four pots over $50, that totaled $486. I lost five pots over $50
that totaled $450. For pots over $100 I won two for $317 and lost one for $184.
You’ll here more about that one later.</p>

<p>I’m back in he saddle.</p>
