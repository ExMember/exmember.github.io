<p>A Midsummer Nights Dream opened Saturday to a lovely and loving crowd. This is a
really magical show and you can see why it’s an audience favorite year after
year.</p>

<p>This Saturday’s show is very special to me because I will be going on as
Flute/Thisby. If you’ve been longing to see me in drag this may be your only
chance.</p>

<p>Saturday June 11 at <a href="https://theatricum.com/">Theatricum Botanicum</a>, 1419 N.
Topanga Canyon Blvd., Topanga, CA. For tickets or more information call the box
office at 310-455-3723 or visit the
<a href="https://theatricum.com/">website</a>.</p>

<p>If you can’t see Saturday’s show there is another matinee June 18, then evening
shows every Thursday night in August and on Labor Day.</p>
