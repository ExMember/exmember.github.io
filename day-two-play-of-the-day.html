<p>I raised to $6 from under-the-gun with JT. I must be tilting already.</p>

<p>The small blind reraises to $20. The loose-passive big blind calls. Effective
stacks are over $200. I call. Two mistakes already, and we are still pre-flop.</p>

<p>Flop is K5Q. The small blind bets $36 into the $60 pot. I semi-bluff reraise
all-in for $205. If he has JJ or TT he’ll have to fold. but since I have JT both
of those are pretty unlikely. Other players may fold AK, but not this one.
That’s mistake three.</p>

<p>He has AA and calls. I don’t get there. I managed three mistakes in three
opportunities.</p>

<p>Bad play on day two: -$225.</p>
