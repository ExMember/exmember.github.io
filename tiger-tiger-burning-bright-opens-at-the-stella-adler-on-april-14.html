<p>From the press release:</p>

<p>“Tiger Tiger Burning Bright” (1962) is set in New Orleans at midcentury. It is
the story of a troubled family. Although the family is Black, its conflicts are
not race specific (as was noted by the New York Times review of the play’s
original Broadway production). It is about what occurs when dreams become
delusions, sometimes through deliberate design.</p>

<p>They’re not destitute. In fact, their home is nearly paid off. Clarence
ostensibly works for the telegraph company, achieving a series of advancements
in pay. In point of fact, his money comes from somewhat more sinister
activities, not unrelated to his good looks.</p>

<p>Mama is the old-fashioned matriarch of the family. She is in perpetual mourning
for son George, reported to have been killed during his military duty.</p>

<p>Clarence’s younger brother, Dan, wants to marry Adelaide, the lovely local girl
who is regularly around their home. But Adelaide has an eye for the better
looking Clarence.</p>

<p>His kid sister, Cille, has a gift for seeing right through things to the heart
of what they really are. It comes with a price, as she is afflicted with
horrible migraines.</p>

<p>Stirring up the stew are their two new neighbors: Celeste, who also notices
Clarence; and Dewey, who takes an immediate shine to Cille. There’s also the
corrupt local preacher, who has a terrible hold on Clarence.</p>

<p>It’s a family held together with a web of deceptions and lies. When truths
become known, can the family survive? Clarence is a young man on the brink: Will
his current course destroy him, or is there hope for a life beyond what’s he
always known? Can Adelaide redeem him? (In a twist, if she can redeem him, it
would be with the love of a bad woman, rather than the love of a good one.) What
will they all do?</p>

<p>Peter S. Feibleman is the playwright. He wrote the play “Cakewalk,” about his
romance with the much older Lillian Hellman. He also wrote the feature film
“Ensign Pulver,” and contributed to the screenplay of “Reds.” He wrote episodes
of the TV series “Columbo” and several novels, including “A Place Without
Twilight,” “Daughters of Necessity,” and “Strangers and Graves.”</p>

<p>Sam Nickens directs. He has helmed a number of shows for Upward Bound
Productions, including last season’s critically acclaimed “The Good Negro,” “No
Place to Be Somebody,” and “The Awakening.”</p>

<p>His cast for “Tiger Tiger Burning Bright” includes (in alphabetical order)
DeShawn Barnes, Damien Burke, Barika Croom, Carl Crudup, Janai Dionne, Gilbert
Hancock, Regina Randolph, Richard Reliford and Collin St. Die.</p>
