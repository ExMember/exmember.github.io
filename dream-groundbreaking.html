<p>On October 15, 2017 I was offered the opportunity to say a few words at
the groundbreaking ceremony for The Dream @ Tamarind South, a 32-unit
building at 1310 Tamarind Avenue.</p>

<p>These are the remarks I prepared:</p>

<p>There are over fifteen hundred people in Hollywood who are homeless.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
Fifteen hundred men, women, and children; fifteen hundred of our neighbors
in this small community are without a safe place to sleep at night.</p>

<p>Even more of our neighbors are at risk of homelessness; housing in Los
Angeles is the most unaffordable in the country.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>But with projects like this one that we can increase the supply of housing
and mitigate the unaffordability crisis and homelessness crisis we are
facing in Hollywood and in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Projects like the Dream at Tamarind are a key part of keeping Hollywood an
exciting, dynamic place where anyone can make it big.</p>

<p>Multi-unit buildings near job and transit centers allow lower-income
families to live here in Hollywood, a region with excellent job and career
prospects that are only getting better.</p>

<p>It allows them to work at those jobs without the long car commutes that
cause smog, noise, traffic congestion, stress, time away from families,
and roadway death.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>So on behalf of myself, my neighborhood, and the community at large
I would like to thank the Strategic Legacy Investment Group and everyone
else that has been involved in bringing this project and projects like it
to Hollywood. Thank you, and we look forward many more.</p>
