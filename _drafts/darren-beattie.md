The presidential administration has appointed Darren Beattie as acting Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, a high-ranking position in the State Department.

Here’s what Beattie posted on Twitter way back in October, “Competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work. Unfortunately, our entire national ideology is predicated on coddling the feelings of women and minorities, and demoralizing competent white men.” https://x.com/DarrenJBeattie/status/1842239185203151053

This is the type of presidential administration we have now, one that no longer hides their white-supremacist, patriarchal views and intentions.
