In one sense,
for me
meditation is
about presence
and practicing
being present.

I sit
on a cushion
for ten minutes
every morning
and I practice
being present
in the current moment.
I do that
by directing
my attention
to the sensations
of my body.

The breath is
a typical and traditional target.

"Breathing in
I am
aware that
I am
breathing in.
Breathing out
I am
aware that
I am
breathing out."

Sometimes
I direct
my attention
to other sensations.
I might
become aware
of tension
in my jaw.
As I focus
my attention
on the sensations
in my jaw,
I might notice
the tension
loosening
and my jaw
relaxing.
I might direct
my attention
to other parts
of my body
or back
to my breath.
Breathing in
I am aware
that I am
breathing in.

In another sense,
for me
mediation is
about directing
my attention
and practicing directing
my attention.

I sit
on a cushion
for ten minutes
every morning
and I practice
noticing when
my attention drifts
and directing
it back
to the present.

My mind wanders
to memories
of the past.
It wanders
to hopes, plans, or fears
of the future.
I notice
that it is wandering
and I direct it
back to the present.

I meditate
when I sit
on a cushion
for ten minutes
every morning.
And I meditate
when I write
my Earlywords.

I sit
in a chair
for seven hundred and fifty words
every day
and I practice
being present
in the current moment.
I do that
by directing
my attention
to the thoughts
in my mind
and typing
those thoughts
into my Earlywords.

"I am writing
my Earlywords.
It is
eight thirty three
in the morning
and I have
just started
to write
my Earlywords."

My mind wanders
to memories
of the past,
to hopes, plans, or fears
of the future.
I notice
it is wandering
and I direct it
back to the present
where I am
writing those wanderings
into my Earlywords.

Every day,
I do
ten minutes
of meditation
sitting
on a cushion
and practicing
returning to the present
by directing
my attention
to the sensations
present in my body.
Every day,
I do
seven hundred and fifty words
of mediation
sitting
on a chair
and practicing
returning to the present
by directing
my attention
to the thoughts
present
in my mind.

Earlywords is
meditation.
