AI is dangerous.
It is dangerous
because
it is powerful
and it is inhuman.

There have
been many stories
warning us of
the AI apocalypse
both in science fiction
and more general
philosophic thought experiments.
My favorite is
Nick Bostrom's
Paperclip Maximizer.

It goes like this:

Imagine
an office-supply company
builds an intelligent machine
to make paperclips.
Paperclips are
good and useful.
And the more paperclips
the machine makes,
the more paperclips
the company can sell,
and the more money
the company makes.
So the company
programs their machine
to make as many paperclips
as it can.

But the machine
is smart,
very smart.
It makes paperclips
out of all
the raw material
in the factory.
Then it
makes paperclips
out of the building
it is in
and the cars
in the parking lot.
Eventually,
the entire planet
is nothing
but paperclips.
The humans are gone
driven to extinction
by a paperclip manufacturing machine.

It's
a terrifying scenario
if you believe
in the possibility
of super-intelligent machines.
It's scary to believe
that we could create
something
powerful enough
and inhumane enough
to destroy us all.
The truth is
that we already have.

The paperclip maximizer
is hypothetical,
a thought experiment.
That exact scenario
is unlikely.
But there are
many like it,
with the same outcome.

If powerful enough, inhumane enough, horrible outcomes
