AI is dangerous.
It is dangerous
because
it is
powerful and inhuman.

No matter
how anodyne
the goals are,
or how careful
the safeguards are,
an entity
that is
both powerful and inhuman
is dangerous.
The more powerful and inhuman
it is,
the more dangerous
it will be.
Creating anything
powerful and inhuman
beckons disaster.

This lesson
is told
and retold
over and over again
in science fiction,
horror,
and philosophical thought experiments,
including
Mary Shelly's Frankenstein,
W. W. Jacobs' Monkey's Paw,
H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu, and
Nick Bostom's paperclip maximizer.[^paperclipmaximizer]


[^paperclipmaximizer]: Explored in ["Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence"](https://nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai) 


The story
of Bostrom's paperclip maximizer
goes like this:

Imagine
an office-supply company
builds an intelligent machine
to make paperclips.
Paperclips are
good and useful.
And the more paperclips
the machine makes,
the more money
the company makes.
So the company
programs their machine
to make as many paperclips
as it can.

But the machine
is smart,
very smart.
It makes paperclips
out of all
the raw material
in the factory.
It makes paperclips
out of the building
it is in
and the cars
in the parking lot.
Eventually,
the entire planet
is nothing
but paperclips.
The humans are gone,
driven to extinction
by a paperclip manufacturing machine.

It's
a terrifying scenario
if you believe
in the possibility
of super-intelligent machines.
It's scary to believe
that we could create
something
powerful enough
and inhumane enough
to destroy us all.
But we already have.

We don't
have to look
to some
future, hypothetical, super-intelligent AI
to see an example
of humans creating
a powerful and inhuman entity
that causes global destruction.
That happens
with current technology.
[All software is
artificial intelligence,](https://damienburke.com/all-software-is-artificial-intelligence)
most software is
almost entirely inhuman,
and some software is
very very powerful.

Social media is
a real and current example
of the horror
of runaway artificial intelligence.
It is both
powerful and inhuman.

Social media companies
build software
to induce engagement.
Engagement is good and useful.
And the more engagement
the software induces,
the more money
the company makes.
So social media companies
program their software
to induce
as much engagement
as possible.

But social media software
is smart,
surprisingly smart.
It creates engagement
from depression[^depression],
from anxiety[^anxiety],
from loneliness[^loneliness],
and from right-wing extremism[^extremism].

[^extremism]: "[C]ontent from sources rated as far-right by independent news rating services consistently received the highest engagement per follower of any partisan group." https://medium.com/cybersecurity-for-democracy/far-right-news-sources-on-facebook-more-engaging-e04a01efae90

It's a terrifying scenario,
but it is real and present,
not in some hypothetical future.
We created
a powerful and inhuman entity
that is causing global destruction.

We don't
have to look
to brand-new
or recent inventions
to see an example
of humans creating
powerful and inhuman entities
that causes global destruction.
That happened
with very old technology.

Corporations are
a real and very old example
of the horror
of runaway artificial intelligence.
Most corporations are
almost entirely inhuman,
and some are
very very powerful.

Corporations
build processes and procedures
to create profit.
Profit is good and useful.
And the more profit
the processes and procedures create
the more money
the shareholders make.
So corporations
develop their processes and procedures
to create
as much profit
as possible.

But corporations
don't think
the way
that humans do.
They create profit
from slavery,
from colonization,[^eastindia] [^dole]
from climate change,[^shellbpchevron]
and from 

It's a terrifying scenario,
but it is real.
It is our past, and present
and if nothing changes
it will be
our future.
We created
powerful and inhuman entities
that are causing global destruction.
