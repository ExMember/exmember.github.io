AI is dangerous.
It is dangerous
because
it is
powerful and inhuman.

No matter
how anodyne
the goals are,
or how careful
the safeguards are,
an entity
that is
both powerful and inhuman
is dangerous.
The more powerful and inhuman
it is,
the more dangerous
it will be.

This lesson
is a constant
in science fiction,
horror, and
philosophical thought experiments
about hypothetical
super-intelligent
artificial intelligence,
such as
Nick Bostom's paperclip maximizer.[^paperclipmaximizer]

[^paperclipmaximizer]: Explored in ["Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence"](https://nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai)

Hypothetical
artificial intelligence
is sometime inhuman
and is often
very very powerful.

Imagine
an office-supply company
builds an intelligent machine
to make paperclips.
Paperclips are
good and useful.
And the more paperclips
the machine makes,
the more money
the company makes.
So the company
programs their machine
to make
as many paperclips
as possible.

But the machine
doesn't think
the way
humans think.
It makes paperclips
out of all
the raw material
in the factory.
It makes paperclips
out of the building
it is in
and the cars
in the parking lot.
Soon,
the entire planet
is nothing
but paperclips.
The humans are gone,
driven to extinction
by a paperclip manufacturing machine.

It's
a terrifying scenario
if you believe
in the possibility
of super-intelligent machines
and understand
the harms
they could cause.

It is horrifying
to believe
that there could be
this powerful and inhuman
machine
causing global destruction.

But entities
like that
already exist.

Most software is
almost entirely inhuman
and some software is
very very powerful.[^allsoftwareisai]

[^allsoftwareisai]: And [all software is artificial intelligence.](https://damienburke.com/all-software-is-artificial-intelligence)

Social media companies
build software
to induce engagement.
Engagement is
good and useful.
And the more engagement
the software induces,
the more money
the company makes.
So social media companies
program their software
to induce
as much engagement
as possible.

But social media software
doesn't think
the way
humans think.
It creates engagement
from depression[^depression],
from anxiety[^anxiety],
from loneliness[^loneliness],
and from far-right extremism[^extremism].

[^extremism]: "[C]ontent from sources rated as far-right by independent news rating services consistently received the highest engagement per follower of any partisan group." https://medium.com/cybersecurity-for-democracy/far-right-news-sources-on-facebook-more-engaging-e04a01efae90

It's
a terrifying scenario
if you know
the reality
of social media
and understand
the harm
it causes.

It is horrifying
to know
that there is
this powerful and inhuman
software
causing global destruction.

But entities
like that
have existed
for centuries.

Most corporations are
almost entirely inhuman
and some corporations are
very very powerful.

Shareholders
build corporations
to create profit.
Profit is
good and useful.
And the more profit
the corporations create
the more money
the shareholders make.
So the shareholders
direct their corporations
to create
as much profit
as possible.[^friedmandoctrine]

But corporations
don't think
the way
that humans do.
They create profit
from addiction [^reynolds]
from colonization,[^eastindia] [^dole]
from slavery,
from genocide, [^ibm] [^calvinklein]
and from climate change. [^shellbpchevron]

It's
a terrifying scenario
if you know
the reality
of corporations
and understand
the harm
they cause.

It is horrifying
to know
that there are
these powerful and inhuman
entities
causing global destruction.
