title: The Value of a Bitcoin

My goal here is to determine the value of bitcoin from first principles.
When I say bitcoin I am referring to the digital asset, not the underlying
technology, software, or protocols.

I will start with the assumption that bitcoin is money. Then, once we have
determined how to measure the value of money, we can apply that process to
bitcoin and see what result we get.

But first a digression.

## What is money?

Money, by definition, has three characteristics. It is a store of value,
a medium of exchange, and a unit of account.

A unit of account is something that is useful to measure the value (or
cost) of other items. In the same way we inches to measure length, we use
a currency, (like dollars) to measure value.

A medium of exchange is something that is useful in trade. I write
software and eat bananas. It's hard to trade grapes for software labor, so
instead I trade my labor for money, which I can then trade for bananas.

A store of value is something that is useful because it can be saved and
it retains its value. Bananas are a poor thing to save. They take up a lot
of space and lose all their value after about a week. Money, in contrast,
is worth about the same as it was last week or month.

## Types of money

Money can be categorized into three different types, commodity money,
representative money, and fiat money.

### Commodity money

A commodity is an economic good that is completely interchangeable.
A pound of coal is indistinguishable from every other pound of coal. An
ounce of copper is equal to every other ounce of copper.

Not all commodities are suitable as money. Barrels of crude oil are too
heavy to carry to the store. Pork bellies rot if they are not kept frozen.

Gold and silver have been used as money throughout most of the world.

### Representative currency

Something that represents commodity money can be used as money in its
place.

Copper is heavy and difficult to ship, so around 800 BC the Tang Dynasty
began to pay merchants with pieces of paper that could be exchanged for
copper in the capital.

As recently as 1933 the US Government issued gold certificate. Each
certificate could be exchanged for a fixed amount of gold.

### Fiat money

Fiat is Latin for "let it be done" and means an authoritative or arbitrary
order.[^fiat-definition] Fiat money is not an economic good like commodity
money, nor does it represent one. It is called fiat because a government
declares it to be money.
