Some people say death is oblivion.
Some think we die and go to heaven.
Blessed peace or completely gone,
But I'm still here and it's not fun.

Sixteen tons up the mountain and then
The boulder rolls down that mountain again.
The lord of hell won't let me go.
I gotta roll this boulder up the mountain once mo'.

I was born a prince of Thessaly,
Became a king, for all to see,
Cheated death a time or three,
And now I'll pay for eternity.

Sixteen tons up the mountain and then
The boulder rolls down that mountain again.
The lord of hell won't let me go.
I gotta roll this boulder up the mountain once mo'.

If you come for me, I'm not gonna hide.
The god of death tried, and nobody died.
Chained to a rock, while he looked aside.
The battle was won but he was tied.

Sixteen tons up the mountain and then
The boulder rolls down that mountain again.
The lord of hell won't let me go.
I gotta roll this boulder up the mountain once mo'.
