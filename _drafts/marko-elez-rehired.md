DOGE staffer Marko Elez (25), resigned after the Wall Street Journal discovered his history of racist statements on Twitter. These included:

“Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool.”

“I would not mind at all if Gaza and Israel were both wiped off the face of the Earth”

"You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity,”

Musk, the vice-president, and the president have all expressed support for Elez’s return.

What do you think? Should people who express openly racist views hold roles at the highest levels of the federal government?
