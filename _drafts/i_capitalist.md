# I, Capitalist

I’ve always considered myself a capitalist. It’s an identity that I must have formed as a child, witness to the long tail of the Cold War, played out on the mat of televised wrestling or the movies with dashing spies and other action heroes.

I held on to that identify as an adult. Through deep scrutiny my knowledge and understanding of economics, history, political science, and public policy were ever increasing, but I never questioned my identity as a capitalist.

I got involved in politics at the local level. I fought hard to make our local area and local government just a tiny bit better. One day, I looked around and all the people I was fight alongside of were socialists. The people I admired the most, aligned with the most, they were socialists, the arch enemies of capitalists and capitalism. What does that make me?

Am I a capitalist? What does it mean to be a capitalist?

## Capitalism, the Vocation

In the society I live in, one needs a continual source of money to survive. Most people need to sell some form of labor for this. We pick fruit, or clean teeth, write code.

But there are a few people who own enough assets that they don’t have to labor at all. They have apartment buildings, or stock certificates, copyrights and those assets (capital) genearate income that they can use to survive. They don’t have a job, their vocation is capitalist.

I’m a not a capitalist in this sense of the word. I’ve aspired to this for as long as I can remember, and still do. But as of this writing it is still just an aspiration.

## Capitalism, the Political System

Politics is the process of allocating power, generally (though not exclusively) governmental power. There are a lot of different ways to allocate power, with a lot of cool names for politicians and political scientists to argue over. Democracy, monarchy, republics, kleptocracy, oliagarchy, the list goes on and on. In real world, there are no pure examples of any of these systems, just systems that have more or less of the defining traits.

Capitalism, as a political structure, is a structure where the more capital you have, the more power you have. Capitalists then, are people who support that political structure.

On it’s face, capitalism looks like a morally bankrupt political structure that no one would support. And in my experience, no one  is open and honest about supporting a system where people with more money have more power. But once you’ve named capitalism as a political system, you start to see it everywhere in policy and in political language.

Political language will center on the preferences of “tax payers,” or the people who “pay a lot of money” for local housing. There is an unexamined belief that because they have or spent more money they should have more rights or influence.

Policy positions like subsidized parking, exclusionary zoning, divestment in public transit bike lanes are capitalist positions because they benefit people who have more money at the expense of those who have less.

I am not a capitalist in this sense.

## Capitalism, the Market System

Finally, capitalism can be described as the free market system. In this sense, capitalist are those who support and advocate for market systems.

A free market system is one where people are free to buy and sell goods and services.

This does not means a laisa-faire world without government. In order to function, free markets require governments to enforce contracts and prevent fraud. Markets must also be protected from monopolies, oligarchies, monopsonies, and oligopsonies. Government  must protect the public from externalities otherwise manufacturers could cut corners spewing toxic chemicals in the air that change the climate and make large parts of the planet uninhabitable.

Free market systems can be a source of extraordinary good in the world. They are a source of extraordinary good.

Of course, they are not a panacea. There are a lot of guardrails needed, and even then not everything should be allowed on the market. But they are a powerful tool. And I am always looking to see how they can be used to make the world better for everyone, especially the most marginalized.

In this sense, I am a capitalist.
