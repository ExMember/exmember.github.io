> The original question, 'Can machines think?' I believe to be too meaningless to deserve discussion. --- Alan Turing [^canmachinesthink]

[Intelligence](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intelligence) is
"the ability
to learn
or understand
or to deal
with new
or trying situations."
Something is [artificial](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artificial)
if it is
"humanly contrived."
Therefore,
something that is
humanly contrived
and has
the ability
to learn
or understand
or deal
with new
or trying situations
is artificial intelligence.

By that standard,
an email server
is artificial intelligence.

An email server
can learn.
It learns
what address
each email
is intended for.
It understands
what servers
can deliver
to different addresses.
It can deal
with new situations,
including
changes in connectivity
and traffic.

Similarly,
all (non-trivial) software
is artificial intelligence.

That is not
what most people are
talking about
when they talk about
"artificial intelligence."
It is
worth exploring
how the term
is used.

Artificial intelligence is
a term used for software
when the operation
of the software
cannot be explained.

Traditionally,
this was
software that
didn't exist.
When no one knew
how to build software
that could play
chess or go
at a high level
that was
artificial intelligence.
When these problems
were solved
it was
no longer
artificial intelligence;
it was min-max algorithms
and customized hardware
doing highly parallelized
alpha-beta pruning.

With current technology,
it is now possible
to create software
whose operation
cannot be explained.
This is done
with techniques
collectively known
as machine learning.

The techniques and technologies
vary greatly
but the underlying process
remains the same.
Start with a
large amount of data
and write
a computer program
that will transform
that data
into another
computer program.

The initial computer program
can be explained.
It creates
a neural net,
or Bayesian filter,
or large language model,
et cetera.
But once
the data set
is large enough
and the analysis
or output
is complex enough,
the resulting computer program
can no longer be explained.
The results are
sometimes interesting and
sometimes valuable.
Because it is
not explainable,
it is called
artificial intelligence.
