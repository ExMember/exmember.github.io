On October 15, 2017 I was offered the opportunity to say a few words at
the groundbreaking ceremony for The Dream @ Tamarind South, a 32-unit
building at 1310 Tamarind Avenue.

These are the remarks I prepared:


According to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority there are over
fifteen hundred people in Hollywood who are homeless.[1] Fifteen hundred
men, women, and children; fifteen hundred of our neighbors in this small
community are without a safe place to sleep at night.

Even more of our neighbors are at risk of homelessness. According to
a report this year from the UCLA Anderson School of Management, housing in
Los Angeles is the most unaffordable in the country.[3]

But it is through projects like this one that we can increase the supply
of housing and mitigate the affordability crisis and homelessness crisis
we are facing in Hollywood and Los Angeles.

Projects like the Dream at Tamarind are a key part of keeping Hollywood
the exciting, dynamic place where anyone can make it big. 

Multi-unit buildings near job and transit centers allow lower-income
families to live here in Hollywood, a region with excellent job and career
prospects that are only getting better.

It allows them to work at those jobs without the long car commutes that
cause smog, noise, traffic congestion, stress, time away from families,
and roadway deaths.[4]

So on behalf of myself, my neighborhood, and the community at large
I would like to thank the Strategic Legacy Investment Group and everyone
else that has been involved in bringing this project and projects like it
to Hollywood. Thank you, and here is to many more.
