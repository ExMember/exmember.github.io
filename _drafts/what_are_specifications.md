# How to Write Specifications

## What is a specification?

Before we can write a specification we have to know what it is.

Specification is a noun, derived from the verb specify. So a specification is
the result of specifying, or something that specifies.

Let's talk about how to write specifications.

You can write them in English if you like. But English is a very imprecise
language. Anything you write will be easy to misinterpret and fail to include
some details.

If you try to write very formal English you will end up with what we call
legalese. It will be incredibly difficult to read and write and it will still be
subject to misinterpretation and missing details.

Write your specifications in code. Executable software is the only effective way
to describe the behavior of executable software.

Write your specifications, in executable software, and then use that software to
drive your development.

I call it specification-driven development!
