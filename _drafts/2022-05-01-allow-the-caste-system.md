In January, I saw an announcement from Nikki Frey. Nikki is the editor of L.A.
Mentary, the local Mensa newsletter.

> "Iâ€™d like to get a paragraph or 2 (or more) from lots of you about your
> experience & ideas to improve education.  I figure a taste of opinions from
> various people will be interesting to the readers."

Well, I must have been in a mood that day. Because I darted off a response that
was brash and unambivalent.

I unthinkingly assumed that Nikki would use it for background or perhaps
quote from it in an article surveying attitudes on education. I was shocked when
I found out they were printing it, as is, in its entirety.

I disapprove of the headline Nikki added: "Allow the Caste System." I do not
know what that is suppose to mean. I do not think the caste system is something we
should continue to allow. It upsets me that Nikki or others might read that into
what I wrote, or that anyone would think that is acceptable to publish.

While I stand by the content of my writing, had I realized it was going to a
larger audience I would have been much more cautious. But as it is public now, I
will include it here:

> Schooling as we know it was designed to teach compliance. The primary outcomes
> are acculturation and compliance which is vitally important for people who
> need to purchase labor and exploit laborers.
> 
> The secondary outcome is to separate adults from children in order to make
> those adults available to those who need to purchase labor and exploit
> laborers.
> 
> Colleges and universities function primarily as filters and indicators of
> class and caste.
> 
> The illusion of academic meritocracy allows the caste system to continue
> unchallenged even though it is almost entirely hereditary.
> 
> That said, I really enjoyed my college days. I had a blast learning everything
> I could, often at the expense of my school work. I still use some of what I
> learned in my career today.
