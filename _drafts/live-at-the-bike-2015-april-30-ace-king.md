## Background

I'm in a no-limit hold'em cash game with $5 blinds and an allowed buy-in of $300
to $1000 dollars.

The game is broadcast on Live at the Bike, so if you have access you can watch
this hand play out in the archives. It's from the April 30, 2015 show and starts
one hour and fifty-one minutes in.

## The action

The first player folds. I am second to act and have `AcQd` and about $1600 in my
stack. I raise to $25.

Everyone folds to the small blind, Paul, who re-raises to $65. He has $325 left
in his stack.

The big blind folds, but I call the $40. There is $130 in the pot.

The flop comes `QhJd6c`. Paul bets $100. I call. There is $330 in the pot.

The turn is an `8c`. Paul goes all-in for $225. I call.

## Conclusion

Paul had `KcKd` but the `Ah` came on the river and I scooped a $779 pot.
