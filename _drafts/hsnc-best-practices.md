# What is a Neighborhood Council?

Neighborhood councils are a group of representatives who volunteer to
serve as advisors to the city of Los Angeles on issues of concern to the
neighborhood.

Their purpose is "to promote more citizen participation in government and
make government responsible to local needs."[^IX.900]

[IX.900] Los Angeles, California, City Charter, art IX, sec. 900.

# What is the Hollywood Studio District Neighborhood Council?

The Hollywood Studio District Neighborhood Council (HSDNC) is the
neighborhood council that represents the Hollywood Studio District of Los
Angeles.

The Hollywood Studio District is the area south of Hollywood Blvd, east of
El Centro Ave, North of Melrose, and west Western Avenue or the Hollywood
freeway.

More information about the HSDNC can be found on their
[website][http://www.hsdnc.org/].

# What is this document?

This document is my personal opinion on how best to operate the HSDNC,
based on my experience as a board member, committee chair, and board
chair, as well as my best understanding of the laws, rules, and
regulations governing neighborhood councils and the guidance offered by
the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment and other city staff.

Some of the things in this document will be specific to the HSDNC, but
I anticipate that much of it will useful to other neighborhood councils in
Los Angeles and maybe even to other small governmental or other
deliberative bodies.

This is a living document, intended to be updated as things and my
understanding of them change. If you would like to recommend any
amendments, updates, or corrections please feel free to email me -- or
better yet, open a pull request.

# What this document is not

This document does not represent the policy, procedures, rules, or opinion
of the HSDNC, the City of Los Angeles, or any other organization.

This document is not legal advice. I am not a lawyer. I am not your
lawyer. If you need a lawyer I believe I am required to advise you find
one licensed to practice law in your jurisdiction. If your neighborhood council
needs legal advice the city attorney's office has an entire division dedicated
to providing that.

# What the HSDNC can do

Through an official action by the board, the HSDNC can:
- Take a position
- Communicate their position to other parts of the city government
- Authorize spending of the HSDNC's budget

Official action is generally a majority vote of board members voting at
a meeting at which there is a quorum.[^V.3]

[V.3] HSDNC Bylaws, art. V, section 3, rev. June 1, 2015.

## Take a position

The HSDNC can take a position on any item whatsoever, with very few
exceptions. (Anything on the ballot?)

The best way to format a position is as a resolution. A resolution is
a single statement consisting of a series of "whereas" clauses describing
the background and reasoning, and one or more "resolved" clauses stating
the position.

Here is an example resolution:

> WHEREAS it is valuable to have the background, reasoning, and
explanation of an action together in one statement; and

> WHEREAS the format of resolutions make it easy to include and
distinguish the background, reasoning, and explanation from the decision
of the body; and

> WHEREAS the resolution format is standardized and familiar to all
government officials; therefore be it

> RESOLVED that this writer recommends positions adopted by the HSDNC be
written as resolutions.

## Communicate their position to other parts of city government

The HSDNC is an advisory board to they city and as such can communicate their
positions to other parts of the city government.

However, the HSDNC cannot communicate their position to governments or
governmental agencies outside the city. The HSDNC is part of the government of
the City of Los Angeles and with the City of Los Angeles only the Mayor and the
City Council have power over intergovernmental relations.

The best way to communicate the HSDNC's position to the city council is via
a Community Impact Statement (CIS). The community impact statement process was
created as a way for neighborhood councils to express their support, opposition,
or suggestions about any matter pending before the city council, city council
committees, or city commission.

If a community impact statement is submitted in time, the NC's position will be
printed on the agenda. The full statement becomes part of the council file.

At meetings where the item appears on the agenda, if the NC has filed
a CIS, a representative from the board will be given five minutes to speak about
the board stance on the matter. Speakers are usually given one to two minutes
for their comments.

The best way to format a CIS is as a resolution like any other position the
board takes. However, it is very important with a CIS to be specific about the
relevant council file; the board stance (for, against, for if amended, against
if amended, no position, neutral position,), and the agency the statement is
directed to (the city council, or a city commission).

Here is an example resolution to submit a CIS:

> WHEREAS the Congress of Neighborhood is very effective at promoting citizen
> participation in government; and

> WHEREAS the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment plans to hold the Congress
> of Neighborhoods in the 4th floor media room, rotunda, Spring St. forecourt,
> and south lawn in city hall on September 9th, 2017 from 6 am to 5 pm;
> therefore be it

> RESOLVED that the Hollywood Studio District Neighborhood Council is for
> Council File 13-0378-S3, directed to the City Council, authorizing the use of
> the 4th floor media room, rotunda, Spring St. forecourt, and south lawn in
> city hall on September 9th, 2017 from 6 am to 5 pm.

## Spend the NC budget

Each neighborhood council is given an annual budget currently amounting to
$47,000 per fiscal year. This money can be used for operations, outreach,
community improvement projects, neighborhood purpose grants (NPG), and
conducting NC elections.

If you wish to apply for an NPG, the application can be found on the [city
clerk's
website][http://clerk.lacity.org/neighborhood-council-funding/documents-and-forms].
Send the completed application, along with all supporting documentation to the
chair and treasurer. They will bring it to the executive committee which will
decide whether to put it on the board agenda.

## What the HSDNC cannot do

The HSDNC cannot do anything that is not in the list above.

If it is not on that list, the HSDNC cannot do it.

# Committees

### Recommend that the Board do things

# How to call a Board meeting

## Time

Regular board meetings should be at the date and time set by the standing
meeting calendar. For the HSDNC this is every second Monday at 6:30 pm.

Special board meetings can be called when necessary but should be avoided. It is
very difficult to find a date and time that all board members are available and
stakeholders, who are familiar with the standing meeting calendar, are less
likely to be aware of a special meeting.

## Place

Board meetings must be held within the boundaries of the NC.

Board meeting locations must be open to the public. [[Cite Brown Act.]]

Board meeting locations must be ADA compliant. [[Cite Brown Act. Link to ADA
compliance checklist.]]

The HSDNC has twenty board members and routinely sees 20 members of the public
at board meetings so meeting locations should accommodate at least 50 people.

## Setting the Agenda

The board agenda is set by the executive committee.[^IIX.2]

To help ensure the best possible agenda and make the executive committee meeting
efficient, the chair should prepare a proposed agenda. The executive committee
can review each item individually to amend or remove as they wish. Afterwards,
the committee can decide to add any agenda items that were not on the chair's
proposed agenda. And finally they can discuss changing the order of agenda items
as they see fit.

The easiest way to create an agenda is to  start with a duplicate of the
previous month's agenda. Change the date on the first page and in the footer,
remove the items that don't happen every month, and update the dates for the
minutes and MER that need to be approved.

The chair should create a proposed agenda for the next meeting as soon as the
current agenda is finalized. This makes it easy to add items as soon as they are
brought to the chair's attention instead of trying to gather them all together
immediately before the executive committee meeting.

It is best to err on the side of including an item on the chair's proposed
agenda even if there are good reasons for it not to be on the board agenda. It
is easy to remove an item from the proposed agenda. It is difficult to remember
to discuss an item that is not on the proposed agenda.

Agenda items should contain enough detail to provide sufficient notice to
a reasonable person about the action the board is contemplating. If the board is
taking a position or submitting a community impact statement, the entire
resolution should be included.

[IIX.2] HSDNC Bylaws, art. IIX, section 2, rev. June 1, 2015.

## Posting the agenda

All NC agendas need to be posted via the city's Early Notification System (ENS),
physically at the Lemon Grove park, and on the HSDNC website.

To post the agenda via ENS send the agenda as a PDF to NC support with the date
and title of the meeting in the subject.

To post the agenda at Lemon Grove park you can go there yourself, or email the
recreation coordinator and ask them to post it for you.

To post the agenda on the website add an event to the [meetings
calendar][https://hsdnc.nationbuilder.com/admin/sites/1/pages/804/events_old] on
NationBuilder and upload the agenda to it as a PDF.

Board agendas should also be sent to the HSDNC [mailing
list][https://hsdnc.nationbuilder.com/admin/broadcasters/1/mailings] on
NationBuilder.

## Paper copies

During the board meeting, board members are going to need the agenda, the
minutes of the previous meeting, the previous month's MER, and possibly other
materials. Distributing these items individually is time-consuming and
disruptive.

Meetings go smoother if every board member is given a packet of the materials
they need before the meeting begins. For ease of use, put the agenda first, and
the rest of the materials in the order they will be needed.

# How to call a Committee meeting

# I want the Board to...

Board meetings are ill-suited for and do not have time to discuss issues in depth and identify the best possible action. Have proposed actions complete for the board to approve, preferably with a committee recommendation.
