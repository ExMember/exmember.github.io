# What is a Neighborhood Council?

Neighborhood councils are a group of representatives who volunteer to
serve as advisors to the city of Los Angeles on issues of concern to the
neighborhood.

Their purpose is "to promote more citizen participation in government and
make government responsible to local needs."[^IX.900]

[IX.900] Los Angeles, California, City Charter, art IX, sec. 900.

# What is the Hollywood Studio District Neighborhood Council?

The Hollywood Studio District Neighborhood Council (HSDNC) is the
neighborhood council that represents the Hollywood Studio District of Los
Angeles.

The Hollywood Studio District is the area south of Hollywood Blvd, east of
El Centro Ave, North of Melrose, and west Western Avenue or the Hollywood
freeway.

More information about the HSDNC can be found on their
[website][http://www.hsdnc.org/].

# What is this document?

This document is my personal opinion on how best to operate the HSDNC,
based on my experience as a board member, committee chair, and board
chair, as well as my best understanding of the laws, rules, and
regulations governing neighborhood councils and the guidance offered by
the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment and other city staff.

Some of the things in this document will be specific to the HSDNC, but
I anticipate that much of it will useful to other neighborhood councils in
Los Angeles and maybe even to other small governmental or other
deliberative bodies.

This is a living document, intended to be updated as things and my
understanding of them change. If you would like to recommend any
amendments, updates, or corrections please feel free to email me -- or
better yet, open a pull request.

# What this document is not

This document does not represent the policy, procedures, rules, or opinion
of the HSDNC, the City of Los Angeles, or any other organization.

This document is not legal advice. I am not a lawyer. I am not your
lawyer. If you need a lawyer I believe I am required to advise you find
one licensed to practice law in your jurisdiction. If your neighborhood
council needs legal advice the city attorney's office has an entire
department dedicated to providing that.

# What the HSDNC can do

Through an official action by the board, the HSDNC can:
- Take a position
- Communicate their position to other parts of the city government
- Authorize spending of the HSDNC's budget

Official action is generally a majority vote of board members voting at
a meeting at which there is a quorum.[^V.3]

[V.3] HSDNC Bylaws, art. V, section 3, rev. June 1, 2015.

## Take a position

The HSDNC can take a position on any item whatsoever, with very few
exceptions. (Anything on the ballot?)

The best way to format a position is as a resolution. A resolution is
a single statement consisting of a series of "whereas" clauses describing
the background and reasoning, and one or more "resolved" clauses stating
the position.

Here is an example resolution:

> WHEREAS it is valuable to have the background, reasoning, and
explanation of an action together in one statement; and

> WHEREAS the format of resolutions make it easy to include and
distinguish the background, reasoning, and explanation from the decision
of the body; and

> WHEREAS the resolution format is standardized and familiar to all
government officials; therefore be it

> RESOLVED that this writer recommends positions adopted by the HSDNC be
written as resolutions.

## Communicate their position to other parts of city government

The HSDNC is an advisory board to they city and as such can communicate their
positions to other parts of the city government.

However, the HSDNC cannot communicate their position to governments or
governmental agencies outside the city. The HSDNC is part of the government of
the City of Los Angeles and with the City of Los Angeles only the Mayor and the
City Council have power over intergovernmental relations.

### Community impact statements

The best way to communicate the HSDNC's position to the city council is via
a Community Impact Statement (CIS). The community impact statement process was
created as a way for neighborhood councils to express their support, opposition,
or suggestions about any matter pending before the city council, city council
committees, or city commission.

If a community impact statement is submitted in time, the NC's position will be
printed on the agenda. The full statement becomes part of the council file.

At meetings where the item appears on the agenda, if the NC has filed
a CIS, a representative from the board will be given five minutes to speak about
the board stance on the matter. Speakers are usually given one to two minutes
for their comments.

The best way to format a CIS is as a resolution like any other position the
board takes. However, it is very important with a CIS to be specific about the
relevant council file; the board stance (for, against, for if amended, against
if amended, no position, neutral position,), and the agency the statement is
directed to (the city council, or a city commission).

Here is an example resolution to submit a CIS:

> WHEREAS the Congress of Neighborhood is very effective at promoting citizen
> participation in government; and

> WHEREAS the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment plans to hold the Congress
> of Neighborhoods in the 4th floor media room, rotunda, Spring St. forecourt,
> and south lawn in city hall on September 9th, 2017 from 6 am to 5 pm;
> therefore be it

> RESOLVED the Hollywood Studio District Neighborhood Council is for Council
> File 13-0378-S3, directed to the City Council, authorizing the use of the 4th
> floor media room, rotunda, Spring St. forecourt, and south lawn in city hall
> on September 9th, 2017 from 6 am to 5 pm.

Board meetings are ill-suited for and do not have time to discuss issues in depth and identify the best possible action. Have proposed actions complete for the board to approve, preferably with a committee recommendation.
