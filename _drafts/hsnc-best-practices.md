# What is a Neighborhood Council?

Neighborhood councils are a group of representatives who volunteer to
serve as advisors to the city of Los Angeles on issues of concern to the
neighborhood.

Their purpose is "to promote more citizen participation in government and
make government responsible to local needs."[^IX.900]

[IX.900] Los Angeles, California, City Charter, art IX, sec. 900.

# What is the Hollywood Studio District Neighborhood Council?

The Hollywood Studio District Neighborhood Council (HSDNC) is the
neighborhood council that represents the Hollywood Studio District of Los
Angeles.

The Hollywood Studio District is the area south of Hollywood Blvd, east of
El Centro Ave, North of Melrose, and west Western Avenue or the Hollywood
freeway.

More information about the HSDNC can be found on their
[website][http://www.hsdnc.org/].

# What is this document?

This document is my personal opinion on how best to operate the HSDNC,
based on my experience as a board member, committee chair, and board
chair, as well as my best understanding of the laws, rules, and
regulations governing neighborhood councils and the guidance offered by
the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment and other city staff.

Some of the things in this document will be specific to the HSDNC, but
I anticipate that much of it will useful to other neighborhood councils in
Los Angeles and maybe even to other small governmental or other
deliberative bodies.

This is a living document, intended to be updated as things and my
understanding of them change. If you would like to recommend any
amendments, updates, or corrections please feel free to email me -- or
better yet, open a pull request.

# What this document is not

This document does not represent the policy, procedures, rules, or opinion
of the HSDNC, the City of Los Angeles, or any other organization.

This document is not legal advice. I am not a lawyer. I am not your
lawyer. If you need a lawyer I believe I am required to advise you find
one licensed to practice law in your jurisdiction. If your neighborhood
council needs legal advice the city attorney's office has an entire
department dedicated to providing that.

# What the HSDNC can do

Through an official action by the board, the HSDNC can:
- Take a position
- Communicate their position to other parts of the city government
- Authorize spending of the HSDNC's budget

Official action is generally a majority vote of board members voting at
a meeting at which there is a quorum.[^V.3]

[V.3] HSDNC Bylaws, art. V, section 3, rev. June 1, 2015.

## Take a position

The HSDNC can take a position on any item whatsoever, with very few
exceptions. (Anything on the ballot?)

The best way to format a position is as a resolution. A resolution is
a single statement consisting of a series of "whereas" clauses describing
the background and reasoning, and one or more "resolved" clauses stating
the position.

Here is an example resolution:

> WHEREAS it is valuable to have the background, reasoning, and
explanation of an action together in one statement; and

> WHEREAS the format of resolutions make it easy to include and
distinguish the background, reasoning, and explanation from the decision
of the body; and

> WHEREAS the resolution format is standardized and familiar to all
government officials; therefore be it

> RESOLVED that this writer recommends positions adopted by the HSDNC be
written as resolutions.

# How to call a Committee meeting

# I want the Board to...

Board meetings are ill-suited for and do not have time to discuss issues in depth and identify the best possible action. Have proposed actions complete for the board to approve, preferably with a committee recommendation.
