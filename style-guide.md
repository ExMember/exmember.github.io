## Math

Math is processed and formatted by [MathJax](http://mathjax.org)

[AsciiMath](http://asciimath.org/) is preferred because it is more readable, but
for things AsciiMath doesn't support, or for importing complicated math from
other places, [LaTeX](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) is also
supported.

### AsciiMath

AsciiMath can be inline. We can demonstrate that with, \` e^(ipi) + 1 = 0 \`,
Euler's identity.

AsciiMath can also appear as it's own paragraph.

 \`e^(ipi) + 1 = 0\`

### LaTeX

LaTeX can be inline.  We can demonstrate that with, $$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 $$,
Euler's identity.

AsciiMath can also appear as it's own paragraph.

$$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 $$
