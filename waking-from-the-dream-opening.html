<p>Come see me in “Velma and Manny,” one of the one-act plays in “Waking from the
Dream” running for the next two weeks at Write Act Repertory.</p>

<p>“Velma and Manny” is a quirky and very funny piece about Velma’s first date, and
the doll she brings along.</p>

<p>The rest of the pieces explore living with delusions in various ways. Come early
for the art show, Japanese treats and tea, and a different pre-show every night.</p>

<p>“Waking from the Dream” at the <a href="https://writeactrep.org/">Write Act Repertory
Theater</a>, 7:30pm June 8th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 20th,
21st, and 22nd. Tickets are $15. Call (323) 469-3113 for reservations.</p>
