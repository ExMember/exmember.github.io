<p>My network television debut is coming up soon! In CSI episode 908, “A Man with A
Horn” I play Stanley Brown, a man with a horn. It was scheduled to air on
November 27th, but that is Thanksgiving and I think a rerun is airing instead.</p>

<p>In the meantime you can look at the empty <a href="http://www.tv.com/csi/young-man-with-a-horn/episode/1216124/summary.html?tag=episode_tabs;overview">TV.com episode
page</a>.</p>
