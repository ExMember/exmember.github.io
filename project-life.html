<p>I’ve been cast as the narrator for <a href="http://www.projectlifemovie.com/">Project:
Life</a>, a mockmentary telling the story of the
creation of the universe as if it were a big budget Hollywood movie.</p>

<p>I’m really excited about this, the bits of the script I’ve seen are great and
everyone is really fun to work with.</p>
