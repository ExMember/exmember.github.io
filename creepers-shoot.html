<p>An extra-terrestial invasion is causing a disturbance in a local grocery store.
Who do you send? Me, of course, and the rest of my SWAT team.</p>

<p>This one was a lot of fun. I got to live out my para-military fantasies running
through a grocery store closed for the night. Much more fun than video games
(even Halo 3) but not quite as satisfying as paintball.</p>

<p>After reading the script and working with C. J. Johnson and his crew I can’t
wait to see movie, even though I’ll probably only be in a few seconds of it.</p>
