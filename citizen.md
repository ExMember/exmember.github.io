# Citizen

As citizen,
I focus
on local, concrete efforts
to improve
my local community
especially for
people who are
most at risk
of harm.

This has led to
a focus on
transportation,
housing,
incarceration,
policing, and
governance.

These desires and focus
drove me
to participate
in the most local
form of government
where I am,
the Los Angeles
Neighborhood Council System.
For seven years
I was
on the board
of the Hollywood Studio District
Neighborhood Council (HSDNC),
serving successively as
vice-chair, chair, and secretary
while also chairing
various committees.

I resigned
from the HSDNC
on February 15, 2022
along with nine
of the eleven
sitting board members.
I wrote about
[our mass resignation](/hsdnc-resignation)
and the 
[immediate fallout.](/hsdnc-resignation-reponses-and-reactions)
