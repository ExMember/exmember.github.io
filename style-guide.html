<p>Math is processed and formatted by <a href="https://mathjax.org">MathJax</a></p>

<p><a href="http://asciimath.org/">AsciiMath</a> is preferred because it is more readable, but
for things AsciiMath doesn’t support, or for importing complicated math from
other places, <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">LaTeX</a> is also
supported.</p>

<h2 id="asciimath">AsciiMath</h2>

<p>AsciiMath can be inline. We can demonstrate that with, ` e^(ipi) + 1 = 0 `,
Euler’s identity.</p>

<p>AsciiMath can also appear as it’s own paragraph.</p>

<p>` e^(ipi) + 1 = 0 `</p>

<h2 id="latex">LaTeX</h2>

<p>LaTeX can be inline.  We can demonstrate that with, \(e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0\),
Euler’s identity.</p>

<p>AsciiMath can also appear as it’s own paragraph.</p>

\[e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0\]
