<p>I am very happy to be working with iEvolve Productions again, this time understudying
the role of Harold Childs III in <em>Landing of the Urban Rebels</em>.</p>

<p>We are running for two weekends only, December 13th through the 23rd and
several nights are already sold out. Last year sold out completely and many
were turned away at the door so get your tickets now.</p>

<p>My performance dates will be announced soon. Watch this space.</p>
