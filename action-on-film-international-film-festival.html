<p>I’ve just found out that “Gambler’s Anonymous” has made it into the <a href="https://www.aoffest.com/">Action on
Film International Film Festival.</a> It will be
screening in the 1:00pm block on July 26th in Old Town Pasadena.</p>

<p>This is really exciting stuff. I can’t wait to see myself on the big screen.</p>
