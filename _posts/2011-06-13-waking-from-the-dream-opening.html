<p>Come see me in "Velma and Manny," one of the one-act plays in "Waking from the Dream" running for the next two weeks at Write Act Repertory.</p>
<p>"Velma and Manny" is a quirky and very funny piece about Velma's first date, and the doll she brings along.</p>
<p>The rest of the pieces explore living with delusions in various ways. Come early for the art show, Japanese treats and tea, and a different pre-show every night.</p>
