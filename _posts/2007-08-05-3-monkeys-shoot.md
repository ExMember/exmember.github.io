"This scene in 12 Monkey's really belongs in Eron: Smartest Men in the Room."
That seemed to be the premise of Donovan Deboer's short "3 Monkeys". At least
that's what I got out of it.  Maybe when I see the final project it'll make more
sense.

If you see it, I'm the stockbrocker in the grey shirt.
