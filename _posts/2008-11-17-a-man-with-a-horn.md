My network television debut is coming up soon! In CSI episode 908, "A Man with A
Horn" I play Stanley Brown, a man with a horn. It was scheduled to air on
November 27th, but that is Thanksgiving and I think a rerun is airing instead.

In the meantime you can look at the empty [TV.com episode
page](http://www.tv.com/csi/young-man-with-a-horn/episode/1216124/summary.html?tag=episode_tabs;overview)
or the [fan wiki](http://csi.wetpaint.com/page/908+%7C+Young+Man+with+a+Horn).
