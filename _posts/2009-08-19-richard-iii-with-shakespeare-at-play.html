<p>I played Brackenbury along with a few other characters in Shakespeare at Play's Richard III August 15 and 16, 2009 in the park at the Buena Vista library in Burbank.</p>
<p>If you were there you were part of a very special outdoor theater experience and I thank you.</p>
<p>If you weren't there you can live vicariously through Brian McGackin's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.burbankleader.com&#47;articles&#47;2009&#47;08&#47;19&#47;entertainment&#47;gnp-shakespeare081909.1.txt">account in the Burbank Leader<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully some pictures will be forthcoming.</p>
