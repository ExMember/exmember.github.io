Did you see "The Olivia Experiment" at Laemmle's Music Hall 3 in Beverly Hills?

Why not? Didn't you read the review in the [LA
Times](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-olivia-experiment-movie-review-20140822-story.html)?
They called it "refreshingly original" and "Porlandia meets Judy Blume."

Did you show up to Friday's screening and see this? ![The Olivia Experiment 7:20
