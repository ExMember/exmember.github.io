"The Olivia Experiment" will open at the [Laemmle Music
Hall](http:\\www.laemmle.com\theaters\4) in Beverly Hills on Friday August 15th.

It's a great movie, I'm in it, and you should see it.

If you still aren't convinced, watch [the hilarious trailer on
YouTube](https:\\www.youtube.com\watch?v=QafV7WHdLHE) and then send it to all
your friends.
