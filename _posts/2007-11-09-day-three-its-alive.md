8 hours. +$465.

The most astonishing thing about live poker is how much more profitable it is.
Everything about live poker says it's should be less profitable:

<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
  <th></th>
  <th>Online</th>
  <th>Live</th>
</tr>

<tr>
  <th>Max buyin</th>
  <td>100 big blinds</td>
  <td>40 big blinds</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <th>Rake</th>
  <td>20% up to $3 max</td>
  <td>$5-$6</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <th>Hands per hour</th>
  <td>100 per table</td>
  <td>20-30</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Despite all this, I estimate I make just as much money on one live table at I do
two-tabling online at the same buyin.

I am very happy with my play today, for the most part I think I played extremely
well. There were a few problems, but even those are things I wouldn't have
noticed if I wasn't playing well in general.

Some notes:

I'm a lot more creative with bet-sizing now. Not too long ago I almost always
made pot-sized bets. When I moved up in limits, my aggression started to be a
liability. I transitioned to half or three-quarter pot sized bets, to make it
more difficult to counter.

After reading Lederer's chapter on leverage in _The Full Tilt Poker Strategy
Guide_ I am much more aware of the impact of different sized bets. I'm
transitioning from trying to make a "big enough" bet, to trying to make the most
profitable bet.

For different players, stack sizes, and situations, the best bet size will vary
wildly. I am really enjoying the mental challenge of trying to figure it out.

On a related note, I've noticed I have a tendency to space out when I'm ahead.
Once I feel like I have an edge over the table I get lazy. Sadly, when my
concentration goes, my edge diminishes, or even disappears entirely. I can only
imagine how much money I've lost that way. It's not enough to play a positive EV
game, I need to be playing with the highest possible EV.

When I am concentrating though, my reads are much more precise. It's not enough
to identify the general strength of the hand; pair less than top-pair, draw,
etc. If you can identify what possible two cards can make up their hand, you can
make much better decisions. Hopefully I can find an example hand to point out
the importance of this sometime.
