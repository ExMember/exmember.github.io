<p>When "Pulp Shakespeare" had its west coast premiere at the Hollywood Fringe it played to sold-out audiences, was critically acclaimed, and awarded Best of Fringe.</p>
<p>Now Her Majesty's Secret Players are bringing it back for a limited run: October 14 through November 13, Friday and Saturday's at 8pm and Sunday's at 2pm at the Theatre Asylum, 6320 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood CA 90038.</p>
<p>In addition to stage-managing I am part of the producing team for this run and I know it's something I can be proud of and I hope you will be there.</p>
<p>Tickets are available now at Plays 411 <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.plays411.net&#47;newsite&#47;show&#47;play_info.asp?show_id=2898">plays411.net&#47;pulp<&#47;a>. For more information visit our <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.hermajestyssecretplayers.org&#47;main&#47;">website<&#47;a>.</p>
