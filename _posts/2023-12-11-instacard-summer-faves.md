Have you seen me in the Instacart _Summer Faves_ TV ads?

I show up about twenty-two seconds in looking like this:

These were extraordinarily fun to shoot. The food was delicious and
the actors in my family were a lot of fun to work with. I even got to shoot a
scene with Aliysa Shareef who starred with me in an [ad for Bread and Butter
wines]() last year!

I've only seen a few of the stills we shot. There were a lot more, some of which
are region specific. If you see them, let me know where!

And there is an entirely different commercial that I know is airing on Hulu and
other places but I have seen yet.
