A Midsummer Nights Dream opened Saturday to a lovely and loving crowd. This is a
really magical show and you can see why it's an audience favorite year after
year.

This Saturday's show is very special to me because I will be going on as
Flute/Thisby. If you've been longing to see me in drag this may be your only
chance.

Saturday June 11 at [Theatricum Botanicum](http://theatricum.com/), 1419 N.
Topanga Canyon Blvd., Topanga, CA. For tickets or more information call the box
office at 310-455-3723 or visit the
[website](http://theatricum.com/tickets.htm).

If you can't see Saturday's show there is another matinee June 18, then evening
shows every Thursday night in August and on Labor Day.
