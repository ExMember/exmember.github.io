<p>Richard Reliford shot and edited this promo video introducing our cast.</p>

<p>I (obviously) didn't know what to say at the time. I would have liked to say more about my character, Clarence Morris; also known as tiger cat, the man of the house, the most handsome man around New Orleans, Mama's beautiful dream, Mr. Book Man, Mama's most important pretend, shadow, hustler, thief, hustling thief, thieving hustler, lover boy of the world, storybook child, candyman, and twilight.</p>
