# Rank Yourself

Compared to others who do what you do, rank yourself.

### Reputation

My reputation as a software engineer is stellar among a few people. It is
excellent among a couple more. But in most of the world I am completely
unknown.

### Knowledge

My knowledge is higher than average among employees and cogs. It is lower than
typical for luminaries and thought-leaders.

### Expertise

Same as knowledge.

### Tools

My tools are sufficient for work in my office. Outside of my office they are
woefully insufficient.

### Handiness

It is not clear how to reach me, how to hire me, or that you would want to.
While I am very available, no potential client knows that or would see me as
such.

## Which will you invest in developing?

I will invest in my reputation and handiness through a broader web presence and
footprint. I will invest in knowledge and expertise through work on personal
projects and in the community.
