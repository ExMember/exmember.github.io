# Organize and Connect

### How and what can you organize and connect?

- Professional poker players
- New software businesses

## Professional Poker players

### List people within your sphere who are disconnected.

Professional poker players are extremely disconnected. Every colleague is an
adversary. They play a negative-sum game, where any one's gain is someone else's
loss. Connecting them would require finding a way they can help each other
without hurting themselves in the process.

### What do they want? Who do they want to be recognized by, trusted by, or learn from?

They want to make money. They want to have viable careers. They want to be
trusted by potential backers. They want to be recognized and admired (or feared)
by other players. They want to learn from skilled and successful players.

## New software companies

### List people within your sphere who are disconnected.

Founders of tech companies. Software teams at startups. Software teams anywhere
working on unproven products and markets.

### What do they want? Who do they want to be recognized by, trusted by, or learn from?

They want certainty that their company or product will be a success. They want
to be recognized and admired and trusted by their employers and investors.
