<p>Kerry Lengel interviewed the director of Pulp Shakespeare:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sex and spatter are also key to the appeal of Pulp Shakespeare, which transforms Quentin Tarantino&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Pulp Fiction into an Elizabethan tragedy. It started out, in, of all places, on Wikispaces.com, where a page dubbed &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Pulp Bard&acirc;&euro; crowdsourced the rewrite.</p>
<p>Director Jordan Mansell made some changes of his own for his Fringe version, produced under the moniker Her Majesty&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Secret Players.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;The through-line for both Tarantino and Shakespeare is interesting characters who like to talk a lot,&acirc;&euro; says Mansell, whose current reading list includes Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Slayer.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;The underlining themes in Shakespeare are love and death and betrayal,&acirc;&euro; he says. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;He really knew the human psyche, and that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s immortal.&acirc;&euro;<&#47;blockquote></p>
