Senator Collins (Maine) has proposed the "Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act of
2016".  The full text of the act is not available, but the according to the
[summary](https://www.collins.senate.gov/sites/default/files/Terrorist%20Firearms%20Prevention%20Act%20of%202016.pdf)
in order prevent terrorists from purchasing firearms in the U.S. it would make
it illegal for anyone on the "No Fly List" or the "Selectee List" to buy a
firearm.

Like most Americans I believe that the rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment
are not absolute, and that terrorists should not be allowed to purchase firearms
in the United States. For this reason, I support the Sen. Collins proposal,
with a couple of common-sense adjustments.

First, the process for adding and removing people on the "No Fly" and "Selectee"
list needs to be clear, transparent, and completely objective. When we are
denying people their fundamental and Constitutionally-guaranteed rights, it is
important that the process be completely transparent and objective.

Secondly, additions to the "No Fly" and "Selectee" lists should not be done in
secret. Before we restrict the fundamental and Constitutionally-guaranteed
rights of anyone they should have the opportunity to examine the evidence
against them and mount a defense.

Thirdly, no one should be added to the "No Fly" or "Selectee" list for anything
less than a violation of the law. It is fundamentally incompatible with the rule
of law to deny people their rights on the basis of suspicion or association. No
one should be added to the "No Fly" list or the "Selectee" list without first
being convicted of a crime.

Finally, persons who have been convicted of a crime and added to the "No Fly" or
"Selectee" list should be removed from those lists when they have finished their
sentence and are released back into the public. If the criminal justice system
has determined that this person no longer poses a threat to the public then
there is no need to continue to restrict their rights.

Senator Collins proposals have none of these safeguards which makes it not
incompatible with the Constitution, but worse an assault on due process, rule of
law, and the fundamental rights of people who have never been convicted or even
charged with a crime.
