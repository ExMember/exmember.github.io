AI is dangerous.
It is dangerous
because
it is
powerful and inhuman.

No matter
how anodyne
the goals are,
or how careful
the safeguards are,
an entity
that is
both powerful and inhuman
is dangerous.
The more powerful and inhuman
it is,
the more dangerous
it will be.

This is
a well-worn lesson
from science fiction,
horror, and
philosophical thought experiments
about hypothetical
super-intelligent
artificial intelligences,
such as
Nick Bostom's paperclip maximizer.[^paperclipmaximizer]

[^paperclipmaximizer]: Explored in [_Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence_](https://nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai).

Hypothetical
artificial intelligences
are sometime inhuman
and are often
very very powerful.

Imagine
an office-supply company
builds an intelligent machine
to make paperclips.
Paperclips are
good and useful.
And the more paperclips
the machine makes,
the more money
the company makes.
So the company
programs their machine
to make
as many paperclips
as possible.

But the machine
doesn't think
the way
humans think.
It makes paperclips
out of all
the raw material
in the factory.
It makes paperclips
out of the building
it is in
and the cars
in the parking lot.
Soon,
the entire planet
is nothing
but paperclips.
The humans are gone,
driven to extinction
by a paperclip manufacturing machine.

It's
a terrifying scenario
if you believe
in the possibility
of super-intelligent machines
and understand
the harms
they could cause.

It is horrifying
to believe
that there could be
this powerful and inhuman
machine
causing global destruction.

But entities
like that
already exist.

Most software is
almost entirely inhuman
and some software is
very very powerful.[^allsoftwareisai]

[^allsoftwareisai]: And [all software is artificial intelligence.](/all-software-is-artificial-intelligence)

Social media companies
build software
to induce engagement.
Engagement is
good and useful.
And the more engagement
the software induces,
the more money
the company makes.
So social media companies
program their software
to induce
as much engagement
as possible.

But social media software
doesn't think
the way
humans think.
It creates engagement
from depression[^depression],
from anxiety[^anxiety],
from loneliness[^loneliness],
and from far-right extremism.[^extremism]

[^depression]: "[Social media] use was significantly associated with increased depression." [_Association Between Social Media Use and Depression Among U.S. Young Adults_](https://doi.org/10.1002/da.22466), Depression and Anxiety, Volume 33, Issue 4, pages 323-331, January 19, 2016

[^anxiety]: "Use of multiple [social media] platforms is independently associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety." [_Use of multiple social media platforms and symptoms of depression and anxiety: A nationally-representative study among U.S. young adults_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.11.013) Computers in Human Behavior. 69. 1-9 April 2017
[^loneliness]: "The limited use group showed significant reductions in loneliness and depression over three weeks compared to the control group." [_No More FOMO: Limiting Social Media Decreases Loneliness and Depression_](https://doi.org/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751) Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology 2018 37:10, 751-768

[^extremism]: "[C]ontent from sources rated as far-right by independent news rating services consistently received the highest engagement per follower of any partisan group." [_Far-right news sources on Facebook more engaging_](https://medium.com/cybersecurity-for-democracy/far-right-news-sources-on-facebook-more-engaging-e04a01efae90) Cybersecurity for Democracy, March 3, 2021

It's
a terrifying scenario
if you know
the reality
of social media
and understand
the harm
it causes.

It is horrifying
to know
that there is
this powerful and inhuman
software
causing global destruction.

But entities
like that
have existed
for centuries.

Most corporations are
almost entirely inhuman
and some corporations are
very very powerful.

Shareholders
build corporations
to create profit.
Profit is
good and useful.
And the more profit
the corporations create
the more money
the shareholders make.
So shareholders
direct their corporations
to create
as much profit
as possible.[^friedmandoctrine]

[^friedmandoctrine]: "[T]here is one and only one social responsibility of business --- to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits." [_A Friedman Doctrine: The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase Its Profits_](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html) Milton Friedman, The New York Times Magazine, September 13, 1970

But corporations
don't think
the way
that humans do.
They create profit
from addiction,[^tobacco]
from colonization,[^eastindia]
from slavery,[^rac]
from genocide,[^ibm]
and from climate change.[^exxon]

[^tobacco]: "In short, defendants have marketed and sold their lethal product with zeal, with deception, with a single-minded focus on their financial success, and without regard for the human tragedy or social costs that success exacted," US District Court ruling in United States v. Philip Morris, quoted in [_Judge rules against Big Tobacco_](https://money.cnn.com/2006/08/17/news/companies/tobacco_ruling/index.html)

[^eastindia]: "[The English East India Company] was essentially the de facto emperor of large portions of India, which was one of the most productive economies in the world at that point.” -- Emily Erikson, [_How the East India Company Became the World’s Most Powerful Monopoly_](https://www.history.com/news/east-india-company-england-trade)

[^rac]: "From 1680 to 1686, the [Royal African Company] transported an average of 5,000 slaves per year, most of which were shipped to colonies in the Caribbean and Virginia." [_What Was the Royal African Company?_](https://www.history.com/news/what-was-the-royal-african-company)

[^ibm]: "IBM and the Nazis jointly designed, and IBM exclusively produced, technologic solutions that enabled Hitler to accelerate and automate key aspects of his persecution of the Jews from the initial identification and social expulsion, to the confiscation and ghettoization, to the deportation and ultimate extermination." [_The business of making the trains to Auschwitz run on time_](https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/The-business-of-making-the-trains-to-Auschwitz-2821685.php), San Francisco Chronicle, May 19, 2002

[^exxon]: "[W]hile their tactics have evolved from outright, blatant climate denial to more subtle forms of lobbying and propaganda, their end goal remains the same. And that’s to stop action on climate change." -- Geoffrey Supran, [_Tracing Big Oil’s PR war to delay action on climate change_](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/09/oil-companies-discourage-climate-action-study-says/), The Harvard Gazette, Sept 28, 2021

It's
a terrifying scenario
if you know
the reality
of corporations
and understand
the harm
they cause.

It is horrifying
to know
that there are
these powerful and inhuman
entities
causing global destruction.
