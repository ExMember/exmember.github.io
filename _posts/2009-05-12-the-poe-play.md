A big thank you goes out to Ella Martin, writer and director of the amazing
original work "The Poe Play," for inviting me to take part in the staged reading
at the Electric Lodge.

Thank you also to the rest of the cast and crew who made it such a wonderful
show and to the people who came out to support original theater.
