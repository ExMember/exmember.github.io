<p>My non-MTV-watching self did not know that this video had been out for quite sometime. I found the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=k9QE_pG0VDg">video<&#47;a> on YouTube. Three minutes and five seconds in you can see me on the right hand side of the star quarterback and antagonist. (His right, not yours)<&#47;p></p>
<p>I'm also visible chasing and being chased by cheerleaders in the ensueing chaos, but it's impossible to recognize me.<&#47;p></p>
