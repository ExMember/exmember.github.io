I played Brackenbury along with a few other characters in Shakespeare at Play's
Richard III August 15 and 16, 2009 in the park at the Buena Vista library in
Burbank.

If you were there you were part of a very special outdoor theater experience and
I thank you.

If you weren't there you can live vicariously through Brian McGackin's account
in the Burbank Leader.

Hopefully some pictures will be forthcoming.
