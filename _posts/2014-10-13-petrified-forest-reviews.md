For once I didn't read the reviews of a show I was in, but that also means I
didn't share them -- until now.

> The story takes on a dark tone when a quartet of gun toting gangster thugs turn
up, holding the others captive. They are played by a tough George Tovar (in the
Bogart role), an animated David Mingrino, Damien Burke, and Roger Payano.

> ... high-stakes drama that is surprisingly still relevant and as wildly
entertaining today as it must have been in 1935 when it was written... top-notch
theatrical entertainment.

> The Petrified Forest endures because it has it all: romance, suspense, danger,
sex and even a little politics. A fantasy of the highway, it unfurls like a
dream of a still-untamed corner of the American West.

> The story has an incredible denouement, with all actors, an amazing ensemble
of 18, each one gifted in his\her own right, and at a level always expected from
the productions at Theatre West. This cast has done a great service to the
playwright's brilliant, and at times, intense story.
