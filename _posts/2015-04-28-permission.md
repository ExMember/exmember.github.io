# Permissions

## How many people would complain if you didnâ€™t send out your newsletter or brochure?

None. Maybe twenty-five people would be disappointed if I was performing on
stage and didn't let them know. Up to a hundred if it were network television.

## Clearly articulate what promise you make to those that give you permission.

I've made an implicit promise to be a friendly and personable person, someone
they like, so it makes them feel good to share in my work and/or success.

## What makes your marketing anticipated, personal and relevant?

Anything that comes from me comes from me as a person, an individual human
being.
