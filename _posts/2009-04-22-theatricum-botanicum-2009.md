This summer I will be in Cymbeline and  A Midsummer Night's Dream at Will Geer's
Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga.

The Theatricum Botanicum is an outdoor theater with a huge stage integrated with
the surrounding woods and trails. It is the only stage I have ever seen that is
suitable for performing Shakespeare, so it's quite a treat to be a part of the
company.

We perform for our first school group on Monday April 27 but don't open for the
public until Sunday May 31.

All the details on at [Theatricum.com](http://theatricum.com). Come and see us!
