<p>Day Six: 6 hours, +$477.</p>
<p>Day Seven: 10 hours, +77.</p>
<p>I'm traveling, playing at rooms I've never played in before, in a town I've never been to before.</p>
<p>The first thing that strikes me is how much different the players are. Even though the stakes are very similar the level of play is incredibly lower. Hopefully, I can talk about the differences in play more in depth later.</p>
<p>The adjustments were difficult for me, and took it a while but I was able to make them. After that play on day six was like operating a printing press from the US Mint. Just that easy.</p>
<p>Day seven was like coming back to the same printing press and finding out that it only printed Monopoly money. I was card dead the entire day. Luckily the characteristics of the table made it correct for me to loosen up the way I usually do when on bad-card-tilt. In addition, I managed to short-circuit the part of my brain that thinks I can substitute aggression for good cards. Those two factors allowed me to squeeze out a profit on the day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I watched a friend get lucky on a horrible play early on day seven to double his stack. A large stack removed his fear of being stuck and gave him the confidence to think he could intimidate people. The result was that played very aggressive and very well; increasing his stack size and giving him more confidence, which made him to play even better. When we had to leave he picked a thousand dollars in profit.</p>
<p>I'm both very proud and very jealous.</p>
