*Project: Life* is screening at the Ruff Cutz Independent Film Festival at the
Boston University Center For Digital Imaging Arts. The festival is November
14-16th, so if you are in Waltham Massachusetts this Sunday you'll have the
chance to see a rough cut of this very exciting film.

If you aren't going to be in Massachusetts this weekend, the [trailer is on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAoD1ZUWbr8).
