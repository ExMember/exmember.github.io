[Project: Life](http://www.projectlifemovie.com/) is screening at the <a
href="http://www.rcifc.com/">Ruff Cutz Independent Film Festival</a> at the
Boston University Center For Digital Imaging Arts. The festival is November
14-16th, so if you are in Waltham Massachusetts this Sunday you'll have the
chance to see a rough cut of this very exciting film.

If you aren't going to be in Massachusetts this weekend, the [trailer is on
YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAoD1ZUWbr8).
