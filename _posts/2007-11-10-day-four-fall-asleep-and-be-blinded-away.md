<p>10 hours. +$124</p>
<p>Had some problems staying focused, especially through a few incredibly long stretches of bad cards. As a result, I probably didn't make the best decisions I could have when I was in the hand.</p>
<p>Right away I can remember two horribly played hands, 8To and AJo.</p>
<p>I was up as much as $300 before having most of my profits blinded away. In a effort to get it back I also played a lot longer than I should have. I'm going to be paying for that today.</p>
