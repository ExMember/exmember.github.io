I've finally managed to post a short clip from "Project: Life," a brilliant
mockumentary I narrated a couple of years ago. See [the
clip](http://damienburke.com/video/project-life/) and then go learn more about
[the movie](http://projectlifemovie.com). Beg them to sell you DVD's. You're
going to want to see this.
