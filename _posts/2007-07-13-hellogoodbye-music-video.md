Just shot a music video for [Hellogoodbye](http://www.hellogoodbye.net/)'s hit
song "Baby it's a Fact".

It was an all-night shoot, but I had about as much fun as a person can have
while working from five-thirty pm to five am.

You might see me in detention, pushing/pulling the chalkboard in the the
foreground. I'm also one of the football players, number 84.

I expect it'll show up on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/hellogoodbyevideos)
at some point.  Let me know if you see it on TV or someplace else.
