Immigration policy is weaponry.\
It started and it still is presently\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wielding control\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With only one goal\
Maintaining and defending white supremacy.

First hundred years of US history,\
Open borders were the policy.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That only changed when\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese men came in\
And threatened white racial hegemony.[^first]

[^first]: The first laws to limit immigration into the United State were the [Oriental Exclusion Act of 1875](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Act_of_1875), which restricted immigration from East Asia; the [Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act), which barred Chinese laborers; the [Geary Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geary_Act) which further restricted immigration from China; and the [Immigration Act of 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1917), which banned immigration from Asia and the Pacific.

One hundred years ago\
To stem the non-white flow\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress step in\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set since then\
Fixed origin country ratios.[^quota]

[^quota]: The [Emergency Quota Act of 1921](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Quota_Act) limited immigration into the US to maintain country-of-origin ratios. The system has been tweaked since then, but the structure hasn't changed, country-of-origin ratios still favor white would-be immigrants.

Immigration policy is weaponry.\
It started and it still is presently\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wielding control\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With only one goal\
Maintaining and defending white supremacy.
