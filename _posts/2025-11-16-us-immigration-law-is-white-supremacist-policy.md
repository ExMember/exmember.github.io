For its
first hundred years
as a country,
the US did not
have any restrictions
on immigration.
The US only began
to enact immigration laws
to control the racial makeup
of the country.

This started with
the Oriental Exclusion Act of 1875,
which barred Chinese women
from immigrating.
Then the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882
which barred Chinese laborers.
Then we had Immigration Act of 1917
which banned immigration
from Asia and the Pacific.
And then there was
the Emergency Quota Act
of 1921,
explicitly limiting immigration
to maintain
country-of-origin ratios.

The quota system became
the standard
for immigration restrictions
throughout the 20th century,
tweaked several times
but always keeping
the same structure,
ensuring that
the same countries-of-origin
(and corresponding races)
were advantaged,
and the rest were disadvantaged.

For as long
as the US
has had immigration restrictions,
they have been
a tool of white supremacy.
The current regime has
turned that up several notches,
using masked gunmen
to snatch people
off the streets,
effecting ethnic cleansing
directly through
imprisonment and removal
and indirectly
via terror.
