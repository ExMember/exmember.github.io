Our immigration policy is weaponry\
It started and it still is presently\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wielding control\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With only one goal\
To maintain and to defend white supremacy.

For as long
as the United States
has had laws
restricting immigration,
those laws
have been white supremacist.
US immigration laws
implement policy
that advantage white people
at the expense
of people
of other races.

For the first hundred years of history\
Open borders were US policy\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That only changed when\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese men came in\
And threatened white racial hegemony.

For its
first hundred years
as a country,
the US did not
have any restrictions
on immigration.
The US only began
to enact immigration laws
to control the racial makeup
of the country.

The first immigration law
in the United Stated was
the [Oriental Exclusion Act of 1875](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Act_of_1875),
which restricted immigration
from East Asia.
The second was
the [Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act)
which barred Chinese laborers.
In 1882,
the [Geary Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geary_Act)
further restricted
immigration from China.
In 1917,
the [Immigration Act of 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1917)
banned immigration
from Asia and the Pacific.

In 1921,
Congress made
the racial basis
of earlier immigration law
explicit
with the [Emergency Quota Act of 1921](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Quota_Act),
which limited immigration
to maintain
country-of-origin ratios.

The quota system became
the standard
for immigration restrictions
throughout the 20th century.
It was
tweaked several times
but always kept
the same structure,
ensuring that
the same countries-of-origin
(and corresponding races)
were advantaged,
and the rest were disadvantaged.

For as long
as the US
has had immigration restrictions,
they have been
a tool of white supremacy.
The current regime has
turned that up several notches,
using masked gunmen
to snatch people
off the streets,
effecting ethnic cleansing
directly through
imprisonment and removal
and indirectly
via terror.
