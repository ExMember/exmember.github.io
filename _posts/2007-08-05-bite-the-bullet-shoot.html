<p>"Bite the Bullet" is a great little short by Jennifer Lee Loy.  I have a supporting role this time, complete with dialog and closeups.  The whole cast and crew for it were wonderful and we wrapped three hours early.  (Yes, 3 hours!)<&#47;p></p>
<p>I'm really proud of some stuff we got on tape, and know I'm going to be really happy with the final project.  This is one I can't wait to show my family.<&#47;p></p>
<p>It's been a great week, constantly going from one shoot to another.  Let's hope for more weeks like this.<&#47;p></p>
