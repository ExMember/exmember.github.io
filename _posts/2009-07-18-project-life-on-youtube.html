<p>I've already talked about how much I love this film, but it hasn't been widely screened until now. Now you can watch <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=KluTIX4m520&hd=1">"Project: Life" on YouTube<&#47;a>. (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=GkzA0ZJ01Rk&hd=1">second half<&#47;a>)</p>
<p>As the narrator, I'm obviously biased but I think you'll love it. If you don't want to commit a whole fifteen minutes without knowing what you are getting into, here's the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=CAoD1ZUWbr8&hd=1">sixty-second trailer<&#47;a>.</p>
