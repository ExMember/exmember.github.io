Come and see me in the ["Silent Roar"](http://www.bethunetheatredanse.org/performances.html) a multimedia music theater experience with the [Bethune Theatredanse](http://www.bethunetheatredanse.org/).

It's an amazing show featuring dozens of incredible dancers and aerialists with original music and video based of the seascapes of Robert Wyland. Plus, I'm in it.

Four performances only, at the Glendale Community College Theatre: Friday February 5th at 8pm, Saturday February 6th at 2pm & 8pm, and Sunday February 7th at 5pm. Tickets available at [Brown Paper Tickets](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/91398) or by phone at (800) 838-3006.
