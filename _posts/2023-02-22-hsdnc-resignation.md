On February 15, 2022,
nine of the eleven
board members
of the Hollywood Studio District Neighborhood Council (HSDNC),
chose to resign
rather than sponsor and support
an organization
with close ties
to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
This ended
my seven and a half
years of service
on the HSDNC board.

Eight of the board members,
including myself,
signed this
joint letter
of resignation:

> Fellow board members, committee members, and stakeholders,
>
> It has been an honor and a privilege to serve on the board of the Hollywood
> Studio District Council (HSDNC) and represent our community in local
> government. However, due to the actions of the Department of Neighborhood
> Empowerment (DONE), we are no longer able to both continue that service and
> follow our conscience.
>
> On February 8, 2023, at a special meeting of the HSDNC board, Mario Hernandez
> of the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment informed the board that:
>
>
> 1. The HSDNC would be sponsoring an event held by the Sheriff’s Youth Foundation;
> 2. The sponsorship would include $4,000 in funding, more than 10% of the HSDNC annual budget; and
> 3. Any HSDNC board members who did not attend would be removed from the board.
>
>
> The board members and stakeholders present vehemently objected to sponsoring
> or participating in this event because of the violent, white-supremacist,
> criminal gang activity historically and currently perpetrated by the Los
> Angeles Sheriff’s Department.
>
>
> Despite the fact that no HSDNC board members or stakeholders had been involved
> in this decision, Mr. Hernandez informed meeting participants that it was “not
> open for negotiation.”
>
> Given the choice of betraying our values or ending our service to the HSDNC,
> the decision is clear. We, the undersigned, do hereby resign from the board of
> the Hollywood Studio District Neighborhood Council, effective immediately.
>
> Black Lives Matter.
>
> In Solidarity,
>
> Michael Tessler, HSDNC Board Chair
>
> Laura Graves, HSDNC Board Vice Chair
>
> Damien Burke, HSDNC Board Secretary
>
> Kali Mutty, HSDNC Board Member
>
> Hayden Bernard, HSDNC Board Member
>
> Frankie Holt, HSDNC Board Member
>
> Cathy Hood, HSDNC Board Member

> Nitzan Levinson, HSDNC Board Member
