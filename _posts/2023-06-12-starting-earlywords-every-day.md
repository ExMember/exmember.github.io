For me,
every day,
the hardest part
about finishing
my EarlyWords
is starting
my EarlyWords.

Writing EarlyWords
is not fun
for me.
To be
more specific,
starting my EarlyWords
is not fun.
Once I get
into the groove
I'm usually
having a blast.
The words
are flowing;
I'm interested
in what
is coming out;
and I am
feeling good
about the process.
But it can take
anywhere from
fifty to five hundred words
to get
to that point.
So I need
a strategy
to get started.
That's what
the comics strips
are for.

I have
a lot
of morning rituals,
things I do
every day
when I get up.
The last of them
is my EarlyWords,
three pages
of stream-of-conciousness writing
I do
just before
getting into
my work
for the day.

But I don't
just sit down
and start typing.
It's not
that easy.

The first thing
I do
is maximize
my browser window
and close
all tabs.
That removes
almost all the distractions
from my screen.
Until I get
in the groove,
it is very easy
for any distraction
to pull me away
from EarlyWords,
or prevent me
from even starting.
When faced
with an unpleasant task,
like starting
my EarlyWords,
I will look
for those distractions
to escape.
Making them
less visible
makes it easier
to avoid them.

The second thing
I do
is open
twenty-four new tabs.
I have
a whole bookmark folder
for them.
Twenty three
are comic strips.
Most are daily,
or close enough
that it's worth
checking them
every day.
The twenty-fourth
is the [EarlyWords homepage](https://earlywords.io).

It's easy
to start
reading comic strips.
They are enjoyable.
And it only takes
a few seconds
to read one.
It is
an easy task
to start on.

It also
gets me
into a rhythm.
Read comic,
close tab,
repeat.
I go through
the tabs
one by one,
and by the time
I am at
the EarlyWords.io tab,
I am
no longer
starting something new.
I'm
in a groove.
It's not
a writing groove;
it's
a tab-closing groove,
but that's enough
to get me started.
After all,
I have to write
to close
this last tab.

But I am
no longer
getting started.
I've gone through
twenty three tabs
and only have
one more to go.
That makes it
a lot easier
to start writing.
