My non-MTV-watching self did not know that this video had been out for quite
sometime. I found the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9QE_pG0VDg) on
YouTube. Three minutes and five seconds in you can see me on the right hand side
of the star quarterback and antagonist. (His right, not yours)

I'm also visible chasing and being chased by cheerleaders in the ensueing chaos,
but it's impossible to recognize me.
