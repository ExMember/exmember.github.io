<p>For once I didn't read the reviews of a show I was in, but that also means I didn't share them &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; until now.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;tolucantimes.info&#47;section&#47;theatre_review&#47;i-have-two-currently-running-productions-to-tell-you-about-this-week&#47;">Tolucan Times<&#47;a></p>
<blockquote><p>The story takes on a dark tone when a quartet of gun toting gangster thugs turn up, holding the others captive. They are played by a tough George Tovar (in the Bogart role), an animated David Mingrino, Damien Burke, and Roger Payano.<&#47;blockquote></p>

<blockquote><p>... high-stakes drama that is surprisingly still relevant and as wildly entertaining today as it must have been in 1935 when it was written... top-notch theatrical entertainment.<&#47;blockquote></p>

<blockquote><p>The Petrified Forest endures because it has it all: romance, suspense, danger, sex and even a little politics. A fantasy of the highway, it unfurls like a dream of a still-untamed corner of the American West.<&#47;blockquote></p>

<blockquote><p>The story has an incredible denouement, with all actors, an amazing ensemble of 18, each one gifted in his&#47;her own right, and at a level always expected from the productions at Theatre West. This cast has done a great service to the playwright's brilliant, and at times, intense story.<&#47;blockquote></p>
