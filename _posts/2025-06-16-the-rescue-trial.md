This Juneteenth, I am performing in a reading of a new play, *The Rescue Trial*.

The story is about Rosetta Douglass, daughter of Fredrick Douglass, and her trip
to Boston to write about local freedom fighter Lewis Hayden.

I play Lewis Hayden, on trial for rescuing a Black American who was going to be
deported from Massachusetts to be re-enslaved in the South.

The reading will be over Zoom, June 19, 2025 at 4pm (PDT). You can find out more and register to attend on [the Calling Up Justice website.](https://callingupjustice.com/digital-bambd-groundbreaking-ceremony-and-the-rescue/)
