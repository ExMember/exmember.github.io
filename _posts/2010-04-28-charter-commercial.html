<p>I recently shot my first commercial, a Charter Cable spot called "Moving In." If you live in a Charter service area, look for it soon.</p>
<p>I'm the first guy out of the truck. I started out carrying cat videos but they'll probably go with Madmen season two instead. Or they may change it in post to something else entirely.</p>
<p>I'm also the guy carrying the chicken recipe bookmarks but my face is obscured but the size of the box.</p>
