I will be stage-managing "Pulp Shakespeare" when it opens tomorrow to a sold-out
house at the Actor's Circle Theatre. Ten-dollar preview tickets are still
available for Sunday at 7pm, after that tickets go up to $15. [Buy your

There is also time to [become a

Majesty's Secret Players and earn the prestige and swag that patrons of the arts
deserve.
