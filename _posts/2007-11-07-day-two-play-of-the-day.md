<p>I raised to $6 from under-the-gun with J&acirc;&trade;&brvbar;T&acirc;&trade;&brvbar;. I must be tilting already.</p>
<p>The small blind reraises to $20. The loose-passive big blind calls. Effective stacks are over $200. I call. Two mistakes already, and we are still pre-flop.</p>
<p>Flop is K&acirc;&trade;&nbsp;5&acirc;&trade;&pound;Q&acirc;&trade;&pound;. The small blind bets $36 into the $60 pot. I semi-bluff reraise all-in for $205. If he has JJ or TT he'll have to fold. but since I have JT both of those are pretty unlikely. Other players may fold AK, but not this one. That's mistake three.</p>
<p>He has AA and calls. I don't get there. I managed three mistakes in three opportunities.</p>
<p>Bad play on day two: -$225.</p>
