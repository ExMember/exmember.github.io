When "Pulp Shakespeare" had its west coast premiere at the Hollywood Fringe it played to sold-out audiences, was critically acclaimed, and awarded Best of Fringe.

Now Her Majesty's Secret Players are bringing it back for a limited run: October 14 through November 13, Friday and Saturday's at 8pm and Sunday's at 2pm at the Theatre Asylum, 6320 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood CA 90038.

In addition to stage-managing I am part of the producing team for this run and I know it's something I can be proud of and I hope you will be there.

Tickets are available now at Plays 411 [plays411.net/pulp](https://www.plays411.net/newsite/show/play_info.asp?show_id=2898). For more information visit our [website](http://www.hermajestyssecretplayers.org/main/).
