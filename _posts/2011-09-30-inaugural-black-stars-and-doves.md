Saturday was the inaugural performance of the iEvolve Theater Group; "Black
Stars & Doves," an outdoor afternoon of poetry.

Thank you to everyone who came out to support this new theater company. Thank
you to my fellow performers for their wonderful work and supportive environment.
And thank you to Langston Hughes who provided the marvelous text for me to
perform.
