A year ago I went up into the Mojave desert to shoot Inanna's Dance, the story
of a man and a goddess. Now that post-production is nearing completion, the
director, Ciaran Vejby, sent me the poster I'm sharing here.

alt="Inanna&#039;s Dance cosmos poster" title="Inanna&#039;s Dance" width="300"
height="240" class="size-medium wp-image-191" />

He also sent me a clip, which I'm not sharing, but I do promise you the thirty
seconds I saw look and sound amazing and I can't wait to see the rest.
