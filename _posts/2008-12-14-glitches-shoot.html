<p>I was lucky enough for Kam Miller to ask me to be a part of her series of monologues, "10 Glitches in 10 Pitches" directed by Barbara Stepansky. Obviously, I jumped at the chance.</p>
<p>Today's shoot was wonderful. I have a lot of faith in Kam and by association in Barbara. Trust in them made it possible to let go of some of my self-consciousness.</p>
<p>We had a lot of fun in the shoot, but more dramatic was the after-effect. I hadn't even noticed how the frustrations of the past week had ground my mood down; not until I saw myself leaving the studio with my smiling head held high and an actual bounce in my step.</p>
<p>When something makes you feel that way, you should make it as big a part of your life as you can. That's why I am an actor.</p>
