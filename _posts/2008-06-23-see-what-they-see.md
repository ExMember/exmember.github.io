It's Thursday night at low-class, high-action card-room. There is a loose
aggressive player running over the table pretty well. A woman in her thirties
comes out firing all-in on the turn into him.

She looks like she's bluffing. She's holding very still, not making eye contact,
moderating her breathing, everything Caro told you about.

It's also a perfect time to make a bluff. He's unlikely to have much. The bet is
the perfect size. And the turn brought a lot of hands that should could
plausibly represent.

I think she has it. I don't think that she is good enough to recognize such a
great bluffing opportunity. And I can't imagine her calling the flop just to
bluff on the turn. I don't think that's part of her game.

The laggy player studies her, asks her a few questions, and finally calls her
even though he can only beat a bluff, and he wins.

Less than an hour later, I'm firing a second or third barrel all-in to the laggy
player. I know he has very little. He starts to study me, and ask me questions.
So I do the exact same thing the bluffer was doing earlier.

I know what tells he looks for, so I showed them to him.

After a moment, he calls. I won a nice sized bet not because I watched and made
note of his tells, but because I watched and made note of the tells he
recognized and acted on when he saw them in others.

It's information warfare out there. Gather all the ammo you can.
