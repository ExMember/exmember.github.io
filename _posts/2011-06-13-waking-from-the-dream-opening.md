Come see me in "Velma and Manny," one of the one-act plays in "Waking from the
Dream" running for the next two weeks at Write Act Repertory.

"Velma and Manny" is a quirky and very funny piece about Velma's first date, and
the doll she brings along.

The rest of the pieces explore living with delusions in various ways. Come early
for the art show, Japanese treats and tea, and a different pre-show every night.

["Waking from the
Dream"](http://www.writeactrep.org/WakingFromTheDream/About_the_Show.html) at
the [Write Act Repertory Theater](http://writeactrep.org/homepage.htm), 7:30pm
June 8th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd. Tickets are $15. Call (323)
469-3113 for reservations.
