I am very proud to be part of this project at the Child Mind Institute to teach
critical mental health and coping skills.

You can see me practicing

as Hedgie in the fifth video of the series.

Check out the rest of [the series](https://childmind.org/healthyminds/parents/)
to learn evidence-based, clinically-proven mental health skills.
