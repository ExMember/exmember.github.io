I was lucky enough for Kam Miller to ask me to be a part of her series of
monologues, "10 Glitches in 10 Pitches" directed by Barbara Stepansky.
Obviously, I jumped at the chance.

Today's shoot was wonderful. I have a lot of faith in Kam and by association in
Barbara. Trust in them made it possible to let go of some of my
self-consciousness.

We had a lot of fun in the shoot, but more dramatic was the after-effect. I
hadn't even noticed how the frustrations of the past week had ground my mood
down; not until I saw myself leaving the studio with my smiling head held high
and an actual bounce in my step.

When something makes you feel that way, you should make it as big a part of your
life as you can. That's why I am an actor.
