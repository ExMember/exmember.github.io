Don't forget, my very first improv comedy show is coming up this Sunday. See me
at the [Upright Citizen's Brigade
Theater](http://losangeles.ucbtheatre.com/), [5919 Franklin Ave, Hollywood CA
90028](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=5919+Franklin+Ave+Hollywood,+CA+90028&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=60.158465,76.025391&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=5919+Franklin+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+California+90068&z=17&iwloc=A),
May 23 at 3:00 pm.

This could be a really awesome show, and I'm certain it'll be even better if you
are there.
