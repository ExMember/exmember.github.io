I've already talked about how much I love this film, but it hasn't been widely
screened until now. Now you can watch ["Project: Life" on
YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KluTIX4m520&hd=1). ([second
half](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkzA0ZJ01Rk&hd=1))

As the narrator, I'm obviously biased but I think you'll love it. If you don't
want to commit a whole fifteen minutes without knowing what you are getting
into, here's the [sixty-second
trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAoD1ZUWbr8&hd=1).
