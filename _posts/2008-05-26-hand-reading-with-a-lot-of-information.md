<p>I've got A&acirc;&trade;&nbsp;J&acirc;&trade;&yen; in early position and raise the $3&#47;$5 blinds to $15. I've been playing very few hands, but that doesn't stop four players from calling. This is not ridiculous, since I started the hand with $600 and these players have me well covered.</p>
<p>The flop is Q&acirc;&trade;&nbsp;T&acirc;&trade;&nbsp;9&acirc;&trade;&brvbar;. I will often play this passively. Last thing I want is to be raised off a monster draw here. But I could be drawing very slim. Also betting out is a great way of disguising my hand, should I hit the nuts on the turn. Add in the distinct possibility I could pick up the pot here and I go ahead and bet $40.</p>
<p>The player on my left raises to $80. A late position player cold-calls $80. The raiser has me covered. The cold-caller has about $400 behind.</p>
<p>The little voice in my head is screaming. "Shenanigans!" it cries.</p>
<p>Neither player can have a pat hand. Because there are two spades out, any made hand is vulnerable. Even K&acirc;&trade;&nbsp;J&acirc;&trade;&nbsp; has six cards that will at worst kill his action. Anyone at the table could show up with A&acirc;&trade;&nbsp;2&acirc;&trade;&nbsp;.</p>
<p>They cannot have a drawing hand either. Any straight draw has to fear the flush draw. Any flush draw has to fear the nut flush draw. Since I have the A&acirc;&trade;&nbsp; I know no one has the nut flush draw.</p>
<p>The table has been playing very strange, in part because it's very deep-stacked. Both players could have a set, two pair, or pair and flush combinations.</p>
<p>I flat call. I've got three outs to the nuts. Maybe more importantly, I know no one will hit the nut flush on the turn, I know no one has a straight already, and I don't think anyone is on the flush draw. In other words, if I hit my straight it's probably good. If a spade comes I can probably draw to the nuts cheap.</p>
<p>The turn is a Ks. So now I know if someone was drawing to spades, it was at most jack-high. Because of the extra straight outs, and the potential of pushing a higher flush draw out, having the J&acirc;&trade;&nbsp; is reason enough to put in a huge raise unless there is the possibility someone has a made straight.</p>
<p>Since no one put in that raise, it's unlikely anyone had the J&acirc;&trade;&nbsp;, which means unless someone was willing to draw to a ten-high flush, no one has a flush right now.</p>
<p>I check. If I am up against a flush, I want to find out cheap. Preferably cheap enough to draw against.</p>
<p>The min-raiser bets $100. The other player folds, and it's back to me.</p>
<p>There is now $400 in the pot. I have $500 in front of me, enough for a pot-sized all-in raise.</p>
<p>It's completely unreasonable for him to have a flush. Even if he does have a flush, it's not the nut flush, so he might not call. And even if he calls with a non-nut flush, I'll have seven outs against it.</p>
<p>I go all-in. He doesn't even hesitate before calling.</p>
<p>Now, I ask you? What the hell does he have?</p>
<p>Maybe AxJ&acirc;&trade;&nbsp; works. He tries to buy a free card on the flop. Figures I can't have a flush on the turn, because that means I'm raising with A9s or worse pre-flop.</p>
<p>Actually, that does work. I couldn't come up with it before because I didn't give him credit for knowing I didn't have a flush.</p>
<p>But once I don't have the flush, he can call a lot of hands on the end with a naked jack. He's getting two to one where only one hand (AJ) beats him. If he has the jack of spade, he even figures to have a redraw against me most of the time.</p>
<p>It's still quite a stretch. It's a lot harder for me not to have a flush when I push that $500 in. And even if I don't have the flush, how can I re-raise push with worse than a jack?</p>
<p>Even if you know I don't have a flush are you calling to chop? Or have you turned your hand into a bluff catcher, betting with the intention of inducing a bluff from an (effectively) naked A&acirc;&trade;&nbsp;?</p>
<p>Do you have a hypothesis? Was there something I missed that might give it away?</p>
<p>The villain had QJ, no spades.</p>
<p>When he called, I actually turned to the guy on my left and said, "How could he call? I have this," and showed him the ace of spades.</p>
<p>I assumed he had some trash spade hand, J&acirc;&trade;&nbsp;9&acirc;&trade;&nbsp;, or something really random. I'd mentally lost the pot already, so it didn't bother me at all when the dealer began to chop it and give me half.</p>
<p>The river was the ace of diamond. He was drawing dead and hit a three-outer to chop. A three-outer that cost me about $640. I realized I was playing too deep, and got a table change not long after.</p>
