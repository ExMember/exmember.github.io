<p>"Project: Life" will be screened during the fourth annual Mockfest, November 12-14 at the Raleigh Studios in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Finally, a chance to see this beautiful and hilarious film on the big screen. You won't see me in the film, I'm the disembodied voice narrating, but I hope to be at the festival.</p>
<p>I'll post more information about date, time, and ticket prices as I get it. For more information about Mockfest go to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;mockfilmfest.weebly.com&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;mockfilmfest.weebly.com&#47;<&#47;a>.</p>
