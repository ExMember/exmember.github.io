The simple answer is,
whatever
I happen
to be thinking
at that moment.

EarlyWords was inspired
by morning pages,
a practice espoused
by Julia Cameron
in her seminal book,
_The Artist's Way_.
She recommends
three pages
of stream of conciousness writing,
by hand,
first thing
in the morning.
EarlyWords is
designed to facilitate
writing up to
seven hundred and fifty words
(approximately three pages)
once a day.

I use it
as a morning pages practice.
I'm not
writing by hand,
like Cameron suggests,
but because I do
so little handwriting
in my life,
it is far better
for me
to write
my morning pages
with a computer keyboard.

Stream of conciousness
means exactly that.
I write exactly
what I am thinking
at that moment.

Not incidently,
that means
my EarlyWords
almost always
start out
very much
the same.
I write
that I am writing
my EarlyWords.
I usually mention
the time and date.
I like
to know
what time
I am
getting started,
in part because
how long
it takes
for me
to get started
on my EarlyWords
is a good proxy
for how productive a day
I'm going
to have.
The other reason
is that
I find it
very unpleasant
to [start EarlyWords](https://earlywords.io/articles/starting-earlywords-every-day)
so I am
usually trying
to figure out
how long
it is going
to take
and when
I am going
to be done.

Sometimes
at that point,
if I was preoccupied
with something
that morning
I'll shift
to that.
Often,
I'll just write
about how unpleasant
the process is
and how
that feels.

Something shifts
around that time.
I start writing
about my feelings
and thoughts,
not even writing
about them,
literally just
writing them down.
And with that exploration,
interesting things
come out.

The hard part is
not filtering.
I type
my thoughts
as quick
as they come,
as quick
as I can,
without concern
if they are
right,
wrong,
self-consistent,
polite,
well-articulated,
or correct
in spelling
or grammar.

The result is
something
I would be
very embarrassed about
if anyone
ever saw it,
so the security
of the EarlyWords site
is extremely important
to me.
I also
turned on
the setting
to automatically
scramble my entries
after fourteen days,
making them unintelligible
and unrecoverable.
