Terri Ann Drigg's wedding disaster comedy was chosen as one of five shorts in
the Cal State Northridge 2009 Film Showcase, May 6th, 2009 at the Leonard H.
Goldenson Theater 5220 Lankershim Blvd, North Hollywood, CA 91601.

The screening start at 7:30pm but admission is first-come, first-serve so it's
recommended you arrive by at least 5pm to get in. Parking is $8.

See me on the Big Screen, enjoy the live band and catered reception, and watch
five awesome shorts in the same theater the Emmy Awards are held.
