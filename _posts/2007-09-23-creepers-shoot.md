An extra-terrestial invasion is causing a disturbance in a local grocery store.
Who do you send? Me, of course, and the rest of my SWAT team.

This one was a lot of fun. I got to live out my para-military fantasies running
through a grocery store closed for the night. Much more fun than video games
(even Halo 3) but not quite as satisfying as paintball.

After reading the script and working with C. J. Johnson and his crew I can't
wait to see movie, even though I'll probably only be in a few seconds of it.
