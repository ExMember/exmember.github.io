On January 1, 2024,
[Cohere](https://www.cohere.coop),
a worker cooperative,
purchased [OpaVote](https://opavote.com),
an online voting platform
specializing in
ranked choice voting.

I am very proud
to be
a member of Cohere.
With Cohere,
Zee Spencer, Ana Ulin, Jennifer Tu, and I
are co-creating
a work environment
that is
cooperative, egalitarian, and sustainable.
Purchasing
a profitable SaaS business
is a huge step forward
for us.

I am very proud
to be
an owner of OpaVote.
Group decision-making
based in democratic principles
respecting the will and desires
of all people involved
is necessary
to create a world
that values
all people and
their needs, preferences, and desires.

By making elections,
especially elections with ranked-choice voting,
easy and inexpensive
to understand and manage,
OpaVote allows
more organizations
to make
more democratic decisions
more often.

In addition,
by increasing familiarity
with ranked-choice voting,
we increase understanding
of when it should be used
and the public's
ability and desire
to push
for more ranked-choice voting
in government elections.
That, in turn,
results in
more power
to the people
by ensuring
better representation in
elected officials and governments.

These are things
that mean
a lot to me
and it is
a privilege and an honor
to be able
to pursue them simultaneously.
