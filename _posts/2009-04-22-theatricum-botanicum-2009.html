<p>This summer I will be in Cymbeline and  A Midsummer Night's Dream at Will Geer's Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga.</p>
<p>The Theatricum Botanicum is an outdoor theater with a huge stage integrated with the surrounding woods and trails. It is the only stage I have ever seen that is suitable for performing Shakespeare, so it's quite a treat to be a part of the company.</p>
<p>We perform for our first school group on Monday April 27 but don't open for the public until Sunday May 31.</p>
<p>All the details on at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;theatricum.com">Theatricum.com<&#47;a>. Come and see us!</p>
