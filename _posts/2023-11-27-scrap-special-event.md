Back in February I was lucky enough to attend a special event for _Scrap_ a
beautiful film I am honored to be a part of. I'm only in one scene, if you blink
you'll miss me, but I am in it.

It was a joy to work with Vivian Kerr (writer/director/producer/lead) and Rachel
Stander (producer) and the finished product is excellent.

The event was a blast too. I always enjoy posing for

_Scrap_ is still travelling the festival circuit. If you have a chance, I highly recommend seeing it. In the meantime, you can learn more [on the website](https://scrapthefilm.com/) or [watch the trailer.](https://scrapthefilm.com/trailer.html)
