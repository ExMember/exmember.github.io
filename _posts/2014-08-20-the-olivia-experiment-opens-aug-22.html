<p>After the 7:20 showing opening night there will be a Q&A with lead actress Skye Noel, screenwriter Alexandra Kominsaruk, director Sonja Schenk, and cinematographer William MacCollum.</p>
<p>Saturday the 23rd will feature free CDs with music from the band Small Sails who are featured on "The Olivia Experiment" soundtrack. </p>
<p>I know I said it was going to open last week, I was wrong. I know, I am surprised as you.</p>
<p>But I'm not wrong when I say I'm in this movie and it's great and you should go see it. Didn't you see the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.theoliviaexperiment.com&#47;?page_id=88">trailer<&#47;a>? What about the bonus sneak-peek preview just posted on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.theoliviaexperiment.com&#47;?p=472">website<&#47;a>?</p>
