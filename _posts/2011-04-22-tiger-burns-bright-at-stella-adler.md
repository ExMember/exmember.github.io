A very kind review from RS Bailey on Curve Wire.

> "Tiger Tiger Burning Bright" is well-written and intelligent play with a
genuine feel for the underside of life and the everyday people it affects. Sam
Nickens has directed it with a natural fluidity and brought forth some
monumental performances from his cast.

> Damien Burke brings a dark internal lure to Clarence.

Come see for yourself, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 8, Sundays at 3 at the
Stella Adler Theatre in Hollywood. For tickets and information go to
