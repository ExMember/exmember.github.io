Ever wonder what would Pulp Fiction be like if it were written by William
Shakespeare? Someone did. And it's pretty awesome.

I've agreed to stage manage the West Coast premiere of "Pulp Shakespeare; or, A
Slurry Tale" at the Hollywood Fringe Festival.

Our little merry band, Her Majesty's Secret Player is in need of patronage.
