"Bite the Bullet" is a great little short by Jennifer Lee Loy.  I have a
supporting role this time, complete with dialog and closeups.  The whole cast
and crew for it were wonderful and we wrapped three hours early.  (Yes, 3
hours!)

I'm really proud of some stuff we got on tape, and know I'm going to be really
happy with the final project.  This is one I can't wait to show my family.

It's been a great week, constantly going from one shoot to another.  Let's hope
for more weeks like this.
