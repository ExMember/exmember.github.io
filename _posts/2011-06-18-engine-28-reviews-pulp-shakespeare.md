Kerry Lengel interviewed the director of Pulp Shakespeare:

> Sex and spatter are also key to the appeal of Pulp Shakespeare, which
> transforms Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction into an Elizabethan tragedy. It
> started out, in, of all places, on Wikispaces.com, where a page dubbed "Pulp
> Bard" crowdsourced the rewrite.

> Director Jordan Monsell made some changes of his own for his Fringe version,
> produced under the moniker Her Majesty's Secret Players.

> "The through-line for both Tarantino and Shakespeare is interesting characters
> who like to talk a lot," says Monsell, whose current reading list includes
> Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Slayer.

> "The underlining themes in Shakespeare are love and death and betrayal," he
> says. "He really knew the human psyche, and that's immortal."
