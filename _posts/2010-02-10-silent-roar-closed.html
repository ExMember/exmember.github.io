<p>Oodles and oodles of thanks to the large, hardworking cast and crew of "Silent Roar" for everything they did to make our short run such an amazing success. It was an amazing show and I am so happy and so lucky to have been a part of it.</p>
<p>Thanks also to everyone who came out to see us.</p>
<p>If you didn't see it, Angela Gomez wrote an wonderful <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.socal.com&#47;6373&#47;172&#47;Silent+Roar.html">review<&#47;a> at Socal.com. I think she did a great job capturing the essence of the show. </p>
