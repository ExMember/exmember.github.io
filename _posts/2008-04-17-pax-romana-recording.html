<p>I'm on the radio!<&#47;p></p>
<p>It's actually not on the radio --it's actually not anywhere at the moment. But it is a radio play I recorded with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.radiofreeplayhouse.com&#47;">Tsunami Radio Theater<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>
<p>It's called "Pax Romana" and it's a very ambitious history set at the peak of the Roman empire. It was also a lot of fun to work on. The cast was very large and very talented.<&#47;p></p>
<p>I'll post a link as soon as the final product is available<&#47;p></p>
