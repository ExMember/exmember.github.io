I recently shot my first commercial, a Charter Cable spot called "Moving In." If
you live in a Charter service area, look for it soon.

I'm the first guy out of the truck. I started out carrying cat videos but
they'll probably go with Madmen season two instead. Or they may change it in
post to something else entirely.

I'm also the guy carrying the chicken recipe bookmarks but my face is obscured
but the size of the box.
