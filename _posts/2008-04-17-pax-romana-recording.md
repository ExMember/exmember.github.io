I'm on the radio!

It's actually not on the radio --it's actually not anywhere at the moment. But
it is a radio play I recorded with Tsunami Radio Theater.

It's called "Pax Romana" and it's a very ambitious history set at the peak of
the Roman empire. It was also a lot of fun to work on. The cast was very large
and very talented.

I'll post a link as soon as the final product is available.
