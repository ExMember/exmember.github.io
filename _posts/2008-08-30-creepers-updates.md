If you are in Atlanta this weekend you are in the right place for the
[Dragon*Con Independent Film Festival](http://filmfest.dragoncon.org/) where you
can see me in the short film
["Creepers"](http://filmfest.dragoncon.org/filmfest08a.htm#18).

Producers CJ Johnson and Genevieve Wheeler will be there doing Q & A so you can
ask them how they got me to run around a grocery store pointing a handgun at
things I'll give you a hint, it wasn't hard.

If you aren't in Atlanta don't panic. "Creepers" will be making it's West Coast
debut soon.
